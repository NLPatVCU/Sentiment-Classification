"I started having paranoia and hallucinations recently so my psychiatrist added 5mg pill of Abilify. I have experienced drooling, face drooping, excessive crying and impulses to cry while speaking. Iâ??m electing to go off of this medication to try something different. It did help me seem more focused but the side effects arenâ??t worth it!  I HATE Abilify!",1.6666666666666667
I started by taking 10 mg once a day. Within 4 days I noticed a remarkable difference in my depression. For the first time I felt like going out and felt full of energy. Since I started taking anti depressants over 30 years ago this medication has made the biggest difference in my life. I started taking in without any promises and was amazed with the results. I would recommend it to someone suffering from depression where their anti depressant alone does not have a complete change in their state of mind. ,5.0

I was put on abilify for depression along with Lexapro.  At first there was no side affects.  Then after about 2 years I gained about 90 pounds.  Also my right hand began to shake.  But the worst thing was not being able to control my bowel movements.  The thing is I did not realize it was the abilify causing these problems.  The way I figured out the cause was I ran out of abilify and was off it for about a week.  I started regaining control of my bowels (this is one thing they don't list as a side affect).  That had to be the most embarrassing period of my life.  Since I quit taking the drug I lost 80 pounds and my hand stopped shaking.  But best of all I have control of my bowels.  They say the drug has different affects on people but it's not the drug for me.  To those that it helped I say hurrah but I've read more negative comments than positive.,1.6666666666666667
"I have suffered with chronic depression for most of my life. I have tried almost every antidepressant out there with varying degrees of success. I currently take 90 mgs of Cymbalta every day. While it is somewhat effective for me I still suffered greatly from nagging depression. It wasn't until my psychiatrist added Abilify that I experienced almost complete relief of my depression. Within two weeks I was feeling better than I have in many years. The feelings of sadness are gone and I wake up feeling ready to face the day. It has helped me tremendously. For me, this drug has worked miracles I never thought possible. ",5.0

When I was 16, I went off my other medication and the Abilify was increased considerably. I started to rapidly gain weight. As much as 5-10 lbs. in a week! After I figured out that it was caused by the Abilify, I immediately met with my psychiatrist and started to go off it. Six months later I lost 30 lbs. THIRTY POUNDS!!!

"I am a mom of a 17 year old boy that has been struggling with depression, recently turning into very angry outbursts. He has been seeing a doctor and has been on zoloft with little help.  He is a great kid and well liked, but no one was aware of his struggles. At home, there were angry outbursts that included hitting and kicking holes in walls and doors, throwing things.  I was afraid he might hurt himself or someone else, and was afraid to leave him alone.  His doctor switched him from the zoloft to lexapro and 2mg of abilify.  I read through many reviews and was just plain terrified to put him on something like this, but I was also terrified to not put him on it, either.  He is just about 18 and was afraid if he hurt someone, he could get into a great deal of trouble.  He started taking it just this week, and it helped almost immediately.   No outbursts, even when somethings are happening that in the past I would think would spark an issue, and he has been generally in a pleasant mood.  I am so thankful!

"I have struggled with Major Depressive Disorder for over 22 years.  I have used several anti-depressants, including Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, and currently Effexor, all of which gave me some relief but by no means left me feeling balanced.

I started Abilify 5 weeks ago as a supplement to Effexor.  Within one week I began to see improvement.  Within 2-3 there was a remarkable difference.  Now, I can say that I have gone depression and anxiety free for a 30 day period for the first time I can remember. Abilify has been nothing short of a miracle for me.  It is not a happy pill, but it has finally brought me the balance I have been seeking for so long.  I had resigned myself to only feeling a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1-10 permanently.  Before Abilify, I could count on one hand the number of good days I had in a YEAR.  Now, I am consistently an 8 or better.

No matter what people may say, serious major depression is not something you can simply will or think yourself out of. One can not will themselves out of depression anymore than someone can will themselves out of epilepsy.

"PLEASE READ ALL> I took Abilify for over a year. After having a son, moving 6x in 4 years (husband in army) I felt myself getting overwhelmed with PPD and Anxiety. The Anxiety was so bad I was not eating, not sleeping and would only stay at home. Abilify was great at 1mg/day. When my doctor felt like I was not making enough progress she upped my dosage. This equated to 35 pounds in 5 months. I was 5""2, 120 pounds. I literally ballooned up so big (mostly in my face and lower abdomen) so quick that most of my friends, relatives even my husband(!) thought I was pregnant again. As a previous sufferer of anorexia and bulemia I began to panic. My anxiety increased so much because of my weight it is hard to describe. For example: if my kids left food on their plates I HAD to eat it. I was obsessed with eating. Additionally, all I did was drink AND RETAIN water. If my husband expressed his concerns I would fly into a rage and eat more. It got to the point where my normal activities (cleaning, laundry, long distance running-my hobby) were near impossible. I began gaining fat that was hanging over my knees, making it difficult to maneuver. Finally I saw my regular (non-pysc) doctor. I saw her after running five miles, THEN DRINKING ONE BOTTLE OF WATER. My face was so swollen that my neck barely fit into my shirt. My doctor did research and blood work and immediately advised me to discontinue use of the Abilify. In three weeks since not taking Abilify I lost 8 pounds. In 4 weeks 12 pounds. I can now run again. The ONLY downside to discontinuing the medication is the emotions and feelings of instability I feel. ",3.6666666666666665

I was angry most of the time. Stayed in my house unless I HAD to go out. Major anxiety, panic attacks were a routine part of my life. My psyche doctor suggested Abilify a year ago, but I was so afraid of all the potential side effects, I delayed trying it. Finally decided something HAD to change in my life. Started it about 4 weeks ago. The 4th day after I started it, I woke up and actually was excited about living again. Had energy, motivation, wanted to go out of the house and became interested in life again.
Now the downside. Am taking only 2mg and am restless, feel like I am manic, am not sleeping more than 4 hrs a night (broken into 2 2hr intervals)Starting to feel like a walking zombie. Difficulty doing simple tasks like balancing my checkbook. I have a position which requires critical thinking and I feel afraid that I won't be able to think clearly and make the right decision. Worst is the sleeplessness. When I started abilify, I was told to take it a night. I did and woke up with no depression, but felt like I was ""electrified"". Paced, went from one task to the other without really accomplishing anything because my mind was racing.

The side affects of increasing blood sugar and triglycerides were also immediate, and so difficult to control, and so affected my physical health, that it affected my work performance and had to go on disability.

"First off, my main complaint for Abilify is it is ridiculously expensive.  I had to beg samples from my PsychD for a while because she insisted I stay on it, but had no insurance.  At first it seemed like it was the perfect drug, but after a couple weeks I had to knock the dose from 5mg to 2.5 mg (just broke them in half)  It made me hyper and edgy at 5mg, and I had nerve and joint pain.  After time, even the 2.5mg made me edgy if I took it daily.  Another doc added Zoloft 50mg and it seemed to help.  I had insurance for a while from my job, but ended up losing it once again, so I tried to get OFF the Abilify, and ended up in the hospital, after being on it for over a year.  If taken alone, I had to take it at maximum every other day, then add Cymbalta, and I had to take it EVERY day with that to counter the effects of the Cymbalta.  It's just been a screwed up ride.  All told, I was on the Abilify for almost 4 years.  Once again without insurance, I can't afford it, can't take it more than 1-2x a week or I get edgy and nasty, so doc has switched me off of it.  It can be an amazing aid when combined with something else but watch your blood sugar, and your weight.  I gained 60 pounds while on it, and it is nigh impossible to get back off.

I told my doctor I was frustrated and wanted to stop taking all meds if I wasn't going to feel better.  I don't want to take pills just for the sake of taking pills.  My doctor then prescribed Celexa.  Still not much difference.  Then, he prescribed Abilify in addition to the Celexa.  I have been taking it for 2-1/2 weeks now.  It seems to be the only thing that has taken away the tiredness.  My mood has definately improved.  Every one around me notices the difference.

"I have been taking 2mg-5mg of Abilify to ""amplify"" my Effexor 150XR BID for almost 3 years and it works very well for my ""Major Depressive Disorder"".

The variable that has changed how much Abilify I take is whether I am taking generic Effexor XR or the Brand, in my case and in my opinion.  Thus, I need more abilify if I don't have the brand name drug.
  
I also notice more side affects at 5mgs.  For example, the company warns in their side effect literature that diabetic type symtoms are possible.  I have noticed these very symtoms, such as increased hunger, thirst, urination, swelling of extemities, craving sweets, etc.  Have others noticed this?  I gained 10 pounds in the last month so I am going down to 2 mg. after I check with my doctor for his approval in our overall treatment plan.  (Anytime I have tried to play doctor by myself it ends up in disaster!)

I will be checking back if other people have these symptoms that lead to weight gain.  I can loose 10lbs. quickly so I am not going to stress over it, this combo of meds works the best out of sooo many I have tried.

I was totally unable to sit still and felt like whatever I was doing, I wanted to be doing something else.  So, I was never happy with what I was doing.  Abilify also gave me an insatiable appetite.  Although I only ate 1400cal/day and kept a daily dairy of my calories, I still gained about 15 lbs.  My doc put me on Chlonipin because of my anxiety, which made me 10X worse.

I eat very healthily so I have not gained any weight, I just eat more. The bigger issue is waking early; I wake up at 4:30 am like I've set an alarm clock. That's 6 1/2 hours of sleep with no naps.

"I was put on Abilify 2mg in addition to Pristiq recently.  The drug was fast-acting (meaning I felt better in less than a week) but I am unfortunately having to stop it due to 2 side effects.

However, my major complaint is constipation.  I have never had such a problem in my entire life--Miralax, milk of magnesia, even prescription constipation medication was not working and I have been resorting to suppositories each and every day for two weeks to manage this.  This is on top of only 3-4h of sleep each night.  It is to the point where the side effects are worse than the benefit I am receiving.

Now I laugh and laugh - which I've missed more than almost anything - but it is very natural ... nothing manic about it.

"Helped greatly with tic's from Torrette Syndrome! Nothing else ever has. Helped with my depression as well. Does have the side effect of Akathisia, which is a feeling of mild dicomfort in my own skin. But this has decreased over time.  Took Cogentin for awhile and this helped.All in all I would recommend this med to someone who has tried almost everything else! The price is high as the insurance only covers 1/2 the price of $425/month!Glad I can afford it at present.",4.0
"I have been on many medications for depression.  I take Abilify along with other meds and have had a tremendously positive response.  It has removed the loss of energy that I suffered from, I feel awak and alive and energetic.  I have the energy to cook dinner--and even dinner for the freezer for the future,am happy doing chores (as happy as you can be doing chores) and overall a positive sense of being.  My heart goes out to those who have had negative side effects from Abilify---I've been there on other medication.  If you are about to try this medicine, know that some people do have positive outcomes, while others do not.  There is a weight gain, and I've started doing minor exercising.  I don't like the weight gain, but at least I feel good again. ",5.0
"I hate this drug,I spend all my time sleeping and the drug caused tremors similar to Parkinson I have been on it a very short time and I find myself jerking awake at night and even twitching when I am asleep.

"I have been taking Abilify for a short time, I have fibromyalgia and depression.It is the first med to help give me some energy, the down side is not being able to sleep and difficulty concentrating. I have noticed a lack in appetite, sometimes I have to force myself to eat. Have lost 8 pounds so far. All my other meds cause weight gain, particularly Lyrica. these dont seem to be the typical effects others are having taking it, I dont know if it has something to do with Lyrica.

My doctor put meon Abilify to enhance the effects of my antidepressants, which are currently Pamelor and trazodone.
Right now all I can say is, I see some areas of improvement,I welcome the increased energy and weight loss. I dont like the insomnia and the inability to stay focused.",3.3333333333333335
"I hated being on this medication. Hated it.  I hared my life to begin with, and this made it worse.  I couldn't stand to be touched, had no sex drive, wanted to eat constantly, was gaining weight that i fought hard to lose, was mad all the time, and I couldn't sit still.  I would even twitch in my sleep! Plus, I got headaches, and would get so lightheaded I felt like I would faint.  If it did anything to help my mood, I might-might-have been able to deal, but I felt no improvement in my mood swings, and I couldn't concentrate on anything except how crappy and crazy I felt.  Yep, it made me feel more crazy than I already was.  Don't take it.",2.0

Felt like I had the flu. The only thing that I notice now is that I definitely can't jump up off the couch, can get dizzy quick. Dr suggested that I take it with food.

I have only been on Abilify for a week.  No drastic swings.  Votes still out.  My concern is for these people that are having such drastic reactions and still listen to their doctor...  COMMON SENSE.  I'm on 2.5 mg now... no side effects.  It will work slower but the chances of side effects are MUCH smaller.  THIS IS A PSYCH DRUG.  USE CAUTION AND MOST OF ALL COMMON SENSE.  Doctors are not God and do not know everything.  Sometimes they just know what the drug reps. tell them......................... I'm a nurse for 20 years so I know of what I speak.... be safe,3.6666666666666665

"Abilfy has giving me the ability to function in my daily life. It really helps me with mood swings and anger issues, basically levels me out. The only draw back is I have gain excessive weight in this year of taking Ability along with Cymbalta. My Dr wants to cut back my doses and this gives me anxiety just thinking about that b/c this is working so well now. But everytime I'm complaining about weight gain so that's why he wants to cut back. I am obese as it is and perhaps the extra weight is causing Dr's concern with medication.",5.0
this med has helped with my anxiety and I feel more balanced being on this med.  My dr took me off of it because I was misdiagnost with bipolor and I ended up in the hospital.  I have noticed some weight gain but able to control with exercise. Overall this med has really helped me feel normal again.,5.0

"Caused feelings toward certain people to have the ability to KILL WITHOUT REMORSE.  Thank Goodness I recognised these thoughts as inappropriate and discontinued the drug.
Wellbutrin and Paxil work best for me.  I have tried many.  ",2.3333333333333335
the first week was hard. Lots of mania but it went away. I do not sleep as well now. Some dry monuth but now a month later i a getting bad headaches. I think do to my sinus's drying out and being stuffy all the time triggering migranes. I can not stop using nose spray which has made it worse. My neck pain got better as well as other pains in my body and that anquish anxity feeling did go abecaue of the migrane i am going to go off. it. It is a shame because it worked. The only thing to work in 8 years. It is worth it to try this medicine even thouth it has risk. It grately inproved my life untill the headaches came. Would recommed it.,3.6666666666666665
"If this is the abilify tablet, I only take 7.5 mg qd and have had a definite change in my depressive symptoms. I was suicidal. I have noticed the minute I go below 7.5 the symptoms return. No anti-depressive, and I have tried every single one of them, has worked for me. This was the last hope and it has helped.
The only draw-back is the weight gain of 10 lbs. I am not active and cannot exercise to lose it. 

Overall, I will continue this drug unless something better comes out.",3.6666666666666665
