"Other than the fact that this makes me very very sleepy, its great.",5
"Ive been taking this medication for a year now and it has helped me in so many ways. I take the 20mg. it took probably about two weeks before i noticed anything different. My family noticed an improvement in my mood the first week. I can wake up in the moring and not feel dread and i can control all my emotions so much better. I dont cry on a drop of a dime anymore. I actually laugh and it feels amazing. This medicine has changed my life. The only thing i get as a sideeffect is the constant yawning, but ive grown accustomed to it. Thank you citalopram.",5
I had taken Citalopram years ago and thought it was replaced as most meds are but I have been on it for a little while(2 weeks) and I already feel better which is great because the medicine I was on made my depression worse.My depression went from a 9 to a 5 on citalopram and I never thought I would get down to a 5 again.,5
"I have been on Citalopram for two years.  Yawning is still frequent.  But I'm please with this medication.  I get a lot less irritated and anxious since beginning this med.
I have noticed a decrease in sexual drive which I'm sure my husband is not happy about.  10 mg. was enough to put me back to feeling myself again.",4
"Never really thought it was depression, but maybe it was. Life was just too hard. This medication works very well, and I can usually tell if I miss a dose. Before I took this I wanted to have more intimate and sexual relations with husband. Downside is not caring if I have sex or not.",5
"I started taking Citalpram 20mg in March 2016, and have recently had my dose increased to 30mg.

The first couple of weeks on the drug were difficult, but it was nothing I couldn't deal with. I yawned a lot, felt less inhibited, and a tiny bit dizzy.

After the side effects wore off, and making sure I took my medication everyday, I can now say I feel much better.

At first I was reluctant to take Citalopram, but I know I needed that extra bit of help. It's not a magic wand, or a wonder drug, but it has helped me to help myself.",5
"Have found that I need to carefully balance the use of this medication with my need for it.  If I take too large of a dose I end of tired and unfocused.  I end up cutting the pills to a 1mg dose and at that level I can tolerate the side effects and still benefit from the drug.  Unfortunately, even at this trivial dose I have a significant sexual side effect.  At times I've stopped the drug for months and the side effect still remains, I fear it may have become permanent.  Now I need to go back on the med, but I'm hesitant because I'm so worried about this side effect.",5
Can't stay awake always tired and doesn't seem to work for me I've had up to 40mg need to try a different tablet,1
cant stay awake,2
"I took the medication for depression, it did a great job, however I was always tired. I couldn't stay awake on my job, couldn't stay awake while driving. I was just putting myself in harm by taking that medicine. The sleepiness, never went away. ",3
,3
Started taking 20 mg in 1996. Up to 40 mg for 8 years. Had some really bad things happen in my life.  Went into a deep depression. Didn't seem like it was working anymore. Went to a psychiatrist who had me try over 12 different anti-depressants over 8 months. None of them worked for me. I ended up back on citalopram 60 mg which is working exceptionally well for me. It also helped me with all my anxiety. Can't say enough good things about this med. ,5
"taken along with abilify and lamectal, it has worked well",5
"I recently had to kick my son out of the house. I could hardly bare it. I couldn't get out of bed and cried every day. I was talked into taking Celexa by my DR. After 3-4 weeks, I did stop crying and could get out of bed. But seeing a counselor helped me the most and have come to terms with my crisis event. After 2.5 months, I have stopped taking Celexa. I talked to my pharmacist and the side effects (for me) were multiple and harsh. Nausea, dizziness, diarrhea and the worst was the trembling in my hands. I thought I was getting Parkinsons! Good luck to all with finding your happiness.",3
"This medication has changed my life. It has worked wonders for me. With any medication there are side effects. I am so anti medication and tried herbal or alternative medication. However with severe anxiety and depression this medication has helped me get back on track in life. I was very anxious about taking the medication but now I am taking it I wish I'd done it sooner. You do need to be patient to see results and also tolerate the side effects because in the long run the benefit of this medicine outweighs the minor side effects. It works for me but maybe not for everyone, however it's worth a try as doctors wouldn't prescribe something without benefiting you and making you better.",5
taking in conjunction with abilify and and lamectal I have never felt better.  I rate this medication an A.  Hope others have the same luch,5
"I've had a chemical imbalance my entire life and mental illness runs on both sides of my family. This is the only medication that has ever helped take the edge off of the emotional roller coaster called ""life"". I've tried other things and this has helped me relax and look at the big picture. Thank God for this medicine and the doctors who created it to help people like me. I feel normal and happy and worry less. ",5
,4
"Started on this just over a month ago. No more urges to end it all, much more calm, sleeping better and co-workers have noticed a great improvement in attitude. ",4
This drug gave me a new life- the one i had always felt just out of reach. And it saved my marriage.,5
"Celexa did not work. I never wanted to take an anti-depressant, but when I was finally forced into taking this, it didn't do anything and made it very hard to sleep at night. Insomnia and depression is not a good mix. I then switched to effexor and it works great!
My doctor told me 50% of people feel an improvement in the first drug they take.",1
"I have been on this medication for five years now for the treatment of depression and anxiety. I absolutely love it, as it allows me to be fully myself. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from depression or anxiety.",5
"I am really happy with the medication Citalopram HBR 20MG.  Nightmare and horrible dreams have stopped.  Thoughts of ending my life have ceased greatly. Find myself a lot happier, yet am tired more which I think is good because now I am sleeping at least 7 hours a night.  One side effect I cannot yet understand is a salty taste in my mouth all the time.",4
less anxiety and more energy,4
"Just wondering if anyone has experienced nightly nightmares while taking this drug? I was on cymbalta fir about 3 years, went off due to nightmares, now this drug has the same effect. The nightmares are not always bad, but dreaming and talking in my sleep nightly",4
I am more tolerant of others and they are of me as well as long as I am on this medication.  I have gained ALOT of weight since starting this but I am still happier.  Started with 20mg but 40mg is what i have been on for years now and I definitely have a better outlook on life.,5
"FIRST, the best way to take this medication is at bedtime, as it really does make a person tired in the morning (though I know not everyone is the same). I have to agree with many on the fact that it is VERY hard to try to get off of this medication. Unfortunately, for me I am better staying on ot. I use it because I just feel out of control when I am not taking it and a cry easily when not on it. I just pray that anyone searching for help gets the help that they need. It has helped me but, with any medication there are most always side effects. Blessings to all!",3
I just started taking citalopram 20mg for depression. So far only side affect is severe nausea but seems to be tapering off but mood seems to be getting happier. I will come back in a few weeks with new review.,4
This medication has helped me resolve my depression and some anxiety issues,5
"Starting taking this drug after heart bypass surgery in 2012. I was diagnosed with depression after the surgery, apparently it is rather common especially in men after a major event such as surgery. It took a while, but is has been helping. Hopefully I wont have to continue taking it for the rest of my life",5
"When I first started taking citalopram, I had dry mouth and night sweats, but those side effects weren't too bad. Within about 2weeks I noticed that I was smiling more-even when I wasn't necessarily happy. Citalopram has most definitely increased my quality of life. I may not always be happy, but I enjoy life more. I get out more and actually participate in life. I was on 40mg for a few years and have now been on 20mg for ~a month bc I'm trying to titrate down as I may be trying to conceive in a few months. I have had some withdrawal symptoms such as ""brain zaps"" which sounds scarier than they really are. I notice my sadness and irritability more, but I'm pretty laser-focused on trying to get pregnant soon. So I'm toughing it out. I am a bit frightened to not take it at all, but I'll be sure to talk about this with my M.D.",5
"No improvement after 3 months @ 40 mg.  TERRIBLE dry mouth, especially at night. I waken throughout night,'cuz my mouth feels like it's full of toxic glue, and I can't get it hydrated no matter what I try.  I'm titrating off starting today!",1
,5
"involuntary quivering, loss of focus.",3
"I was on this for two years for depression/anxiety.  At first it worked, but I had to keep increasing my dose and finally it just quit working completely.  Not only was I JUST as depressed as before, but I also gained 25 pounds and can't lose any more than 5 pounds after having been off if for four months.  I do believe it has done something to my metabolism and really hope I can get my body to return to normal.  If I could go back in time, I would NEVER have gotten on this horrible drug.  I will never take an antidepressant again. ",1
Depression has greatly increased,1
"I have been on this med for over 10 yrs and don't remember specific side effects early on other than dry mouth.  I notice that I have completely lost interest in sex (but am also menopausal, so which caused that?  idk)  I have had horrible weight gain over the years and like so many others have tried to go off the medication and cannot.  I can tell (as my husband can) if I forgot to take it or if I am even LATE taking it on a particular day.  A couple of years ago my doc added bupropion as the citalopram did not seem to be as effective anymore.  I do feel though, that my quality of life has been much improved with this med.  ",4
"Adjusting to 10mg of Cipralex was odd, it disoriented me. I was in a daze for a week. However, after three weeks, my mood was substantially lifted. 

I highly recommend this anti-depressant for depression sufferers. 

I have never felt so normal in such a long time. But I developed a weird sleep problem. I'd sleep 14 hours a night. I couldn't get out of bed otherwise. I don't know if it's my condition or if it was Cipralex. 

I could only fully and actively function for a good 2-3 hours each day. Other times, I was sleepy and tired. Just constantly fatigued. 

I talked to my doctor about trying Prozac and he thought it was a good experiment. But I'm very hesitant after seeing the plentiful terrible reviews on WebMD of Prozac. 

Maybe I should stick with this sleeping problem than risk all of those seemingly commonly experienced side effects.",5
dealing with chronic pain daily and went into a deep depression. This product helped me to recover so that I could work at least part time.,4
for some reason this medacation makes me have a iner outer body feeling like i have been on a hard hung over drunk.,2
This drug had a significant positive impact on my life.  There were many minor side affects at first but the went away for the most part.,5
"Been on citalopram first 20mg then up to 40mg then 60mg hen recalled the maximum dosage so I've been on 40mg a day since. I can honestly say it's changed my life for the better. However, have you missed a day or so's dosage by mistake?! Omg dreadful feeling!!! And apparently it's not addictive!!! Yeah ok then :/ ",5
"I've been told, by doctors through the years, that I've been depressed all my life and don't know it.  Was prescribed Wellbutrin but it seems I'm one of those rarer side effects.  Now, I have been prescribed 10mg of this at bedtime.  I also have low testosterone, adult ADD they say and high blood pressure.  I. Wondering if anyone has had similar prognosis and what they have done that worked?  I exercise regularly and eat decent.  dadtech@hotmail.com",1
"It's working, but I feel like I need to change mg.",4
"This medication has worked for me for years - cannot go without it!! I've see first-hand what I'm like without it!!
",5
"Too many side effects to warrant its use in my case, was slightly effective but my mild depression didnt warrant use of what I see as quite a powerful mind changing substance. It helped but at a cost.",1
Very little side effects except for a few sleepless nights. My depression lifted within six weeks and i felt a lot better. So I would recommend the drug to others. ,4
"Still experiencing depression,both situational and chemical insufficiency",2

"I've had depression for about 10 years till I decided to tell a Dr. He put me on 20mg citalopram and I took it for about a year.  It didn't help as much as he said it would but it did help a bit.  I would say it made me more balanced.  It didn't exactly make me happy but it took most of my bad thoughts away.  I didn't want to be stuck taking a medication the rest of my life so I stopped taking it to see if I could do without.  Bad idea.  Terrible side effects for 2-3 weeks.  I was dizzy the whole time and got headaches. Not to mention the bad episodes were back.  After the dreaded few weeks the side effects went away but I was still sad.  So finally 6months later I saw a new Dr. who just put me on 20mg Prozac, I'm sure it will be like the same thing.",4
Only problem I've experienced is drowsiness.But have had a complete change in my attitude and outlook in life. Used to take Prozac and it quit working for me.,5
,5
"I was started on the 10mg dose and the first two weeks I felt great. My irritability and angery impulsive thoughts went away. I was back to my old self but by week three I could feel the anger and irritation coming back and by week 5 I was back to biting peoples heads off and not wanting to do anything responsible. I just went back for a follow up with my doctor and he changed my dose to 20 mg and I am starting counseling to supplement the medication. I am hoping it continues to help. As far as the side effects, I have had none but I started taking this medication with a positive attitude that I wouldn't be affected by the tiredness or the weight gain and so far so good.",3
"in the beginning, lots of yawning, and spacy but now it just takes the edge off...had postpartum, started taking 20 mg but now 10mg. have a stressful job and helps to stay focused and remain positive. ",4
I HAVE BEEN ON THIS MED FOR A WEEK NOW. IM SUPER DROWSY MY LEG AND ARM TWITCH IM ITCHY.ILL GET A BURST OF ENERGY THEN CRASH. I STILL DONT WANT TO BE BOTHERD BY PEOPLE. I GET IRRITATED AFTER A FEW HOURS BUT WHEN I FIRST TAKE IT IT CLAMS ME NO IRRITATION FULL OF ENERGY THEN BOOM ... I HAVE TO GO TO SLEEP AND I HAVE NO DESIRE TO DO ANYTHING.... I DONT KNOW IF THIS DRUG IS WORKING ONLY BAD SIDE EFFECT IS I KEEP GETTING HEADACHES AND DRY MOUTH ... ... ILL SEE HOW THIS GOES THE REST OF THIS MONTH ...  ,3
"So far I've had no bad side effects other than a lot a yawning, slight headache and a bit of shakiness. I have been told I look better but I don't feel any changes ",3

"I have muscles all over my body that jerk,left leg is worse muscles feel like they are moving like rolling all the time. the tingling is from my hip down to the bottom of my feet. Don't like the feeling at all

"after my wife died of 29 years of marriage, I had a heart attack 5 months later. my doctor started me on this medicine after she died in my arms. it seemed to work, but felt so tired, I am taking 20 mg a day in the morning.i have tried stopping this medicine an cant, it feels like electric shocks all over my body, the first 2 days I have lots of energy but the tingles all over my body makes me start taking it again. I think it makes the depression worse. I wish I had went to counseling than using this poison ,I also gained 40 pounds. Try counseling before this, once you get on it its no getting off",3

dreaming with being vocal,4
"itching, hives severe",4
I can see not improvement,3
"starting on 5mg for a month then will go up to 10mg. I don't want to go too fast. You are meant to increase it slowly to avoid the side affects. Only meant to take 20mg for all patients. some side effects on 5mg-sleepy, a bit of nausea, but feeling less stressed. I am concerned that my doctor didn't say to start slowly on them. I told my pharmacist that I'd had bad effects from amitriptyline years ago and that I wanted to start really slowly. She said 3 days with 5 mg.. then 3 days with 10mg, then 20 mg after that. I am not gonna risk that! Plus my driving has been a bit affected at 5mg. Start slow people. And if having bad side affects go back to your doctor to change the medication. Hope you all feel better soon, and be kind to yourselves and tell friends and loved ones how they can support you at this time. ",3
"Have been taking the drug for over 5 years. Did well up until recently.  All of a sudden it stopped working, completely.  Don't know why. ",2
"I seem to still have a lot of anxiety moments even after several years of use. Sometimes there are heart palpitations, especially at night.",4
"because of my insurance, I have to take the generic version, and the pharmacy does not seem to be able to keep the same stuff on regular basis, it changes manufacturers, and that is when all hell brakes loose. Nothing that is not the real thing is as effective, why? also I have notice that if the pills are not white, their performance is not the same, why? I am currently taking some peachy color stuff that does not work, no matter what they say that the dosage is the same, my body knows best and it is  not.

Not very effective & causes orgasm problems.,2

"I am only on this medication for 1 month.  Once I can drag myself out of bed & shower, I feel in a much better mood (not crying all the time, etc).  HOWEVER...I am SO exhausted!  I am optimistic & really hope this symptom is temporary.  If I have the day off of work, I can almost sleep 15 hrs or more!  Not good; I want to get out of that slump of sleeping all the time like before.  I currently take citirizine for allergies; montelukast for cough daily.  Maybe the combination is not good with the Citalopram.  Any comments would be greatly appreciated.   ",4
"I was given this generic, actually two generics (both new to me) were mixed in one prescription container. I had been doing fine on another citalopram generic and am again now. But for the month of April I went from not crying at all while on the meds (a trade off I accepted) to crying every day and feeling extremely depressed. It was as if I was taking nothing at all. ",1
" For me, citalopram has been amazing.  I wish I would have started taking it 15 years earlier.  It's hard to imagine life now without it.  It was prescribed to me after I had a heart attack, but it seems to work as much on anxiety as depression.",5
"helps with depression, then it no longer works.  experience stiffening of legs and 1 leg jumps",2
"They prescribed this drug because of the depression I experienced when my testosterone went low. I should have had the testosterone issue treated properly, but they insisted I used an ineffective testosterone gel. A year ago I found out that getting testosterone injections was far more effective and less expensive than androgen.  by then I was hooked on Celexa/Citalopram. I eventually weaned myself off of anti depressants, (thanks to medical mj which helped immensely, and I no longer need that) - but after 3 weeks off celexa, and my test levels normal, I had the biggest spiritual breakthru in my life. My gut feeling is BigPharma does not care about the condition of your soul, they just want to make money.  Anti depressants are only for people who absolutely need them or will die. I would do everything in my power to treat the real cause of depression, and not use an anti depressant. NEVER AGAIN for me. At age 58, my soul is finally free and I am back to normal and happy now",1
a little more less anxious,4
"this medicatin low your sex driver,but is very good because it keep you on a good mood and very relax.I stop it because of the sex drive, hope they can improve.",5
I seem to  get restlesss leg syndrome if I wait until bedtime to take this med. I also had to include impramine with it to get a better effect.,3
no problem,3
I just began to notice hair loss on my arms and legs,4
"Against my wishes, my pcp prescribed this to me because my mother wanted a quick fix instead of some therapy (@ age 17). It gave me worse depression symptoms; I could/would not go to school, antisocial, barely ate. When I got off of it, I went through a severe withdrawal consisting of cold sweats and rage for 2 weeks.",1
good experience,5
"I started taking Citalopram when i was 17 years old. I'm now 19 years old and still on this. Its help with my depression alot. One thing I have noticed is that when i started taking this pill i only had depression, and now if I don't take the pill for a week or so my depression and anxiety is at an all time high. over all this pill has changed my life for a positive.",5
,4
"I am smiling more often, much more happy, and less negative feeling towards life.",5
"This wonderdrug is a lifesaver! I was unbelievably low, started taking it, and could not believe the positive results!

In retrospect, I discovered that I have been depressed most of my life. After hitting a major low, I asked my doctor for help, and he prescribed Celexa (Citalopram).

The only ""negative"" side effect is extremely low sex drive (on a scale of 1 to 10, about 0.5). However, considering how life is now worth living, I hardly even care! You probably can't understand unless you've experienced it...

For people just starting to take Celexa (or Citalopram), I suggest starting with no more than 10 mg in the morning. Don't take it at night! The side effects I experienced by starting off with 20 mg at night might not have been caused by the medication (according to my doctor), but I suggest that you take no chances: start in the morning with or after breakfast. Keep in mind that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it is NOT a train coming at you!",5
"I have severe sweating, muscle and joint soreness. Overall, mentally I feel happy and content, except for my achy body.",5
"I currently take 60 mg of this medication. It has not helped at all. repeated anxiety attacks, insomnia and social anxiety has steadily increased. however, trying to get my Dr to change my medication is impossible. Changing dr's and treatments.",2

"I'm 19, but have been on this since I was 17. It worked fantastic for the first year. But my body started becoming too used to the medication, so I tried taking a higher dose, and doing that made me depressed all over again. Now I'm back to 20mg once a day and feeling down in the dumps again.",4

Was previously on Effexor but was changed to citalopram because of cost ($4 at Walmart) and I cannot tell any difference from one medication to the other. I feel at peace & happy at all times.,5

"I have been on this medication since June and it has help my moods drasticly!!! BUT since August I have been experiencing sores in my mouth that look like canker sores.

I was terribly sad living with my adult daughter in her home and working in her office.  She became increasingly irritated with me and fresh with her mouth.

This medication doesn't work at all. ,1
"After taking this medication for only 7 days, my brother-in-law commited suicide.  He was a kind, gentle man who never talked of suicide, was dealing with health issues (gall bladder problems) and they put him on this medication because it was taking the stomach doctor so long to get him in to take care of his stomach issues.  He was a person who never would have even thought of hurting himself nor his family.  He had a loving wife, loving children and grandchildren.  They are now having to face losing him this way.  He was not monitored adequately by his treating physician who prescribed this medication.  The whole family knows that this drug made him see suicide as his only way for relief from his frustrations.  Please, please, do not take this medication under any circumstances unless you are confined to a hospital or clinic where you can be monitored 24 hours a day!!!",1

"have been through a really tough year and needed i needed help

"I'm 17 and this was my first antidepressant. I suffer a severe depression, minor anxiety, and compulsive skin picking. In the first month the suicidal thoughts were the worse they've ever been, (I told my mom this and I was monitored so nothing rash was done) but I'm hitting my second month now and it's not so bad. It has helped ten-fold with the depression and anxiety, however it has made my skin picking dramatically worse. For me, that's not too bad to deal with because my skin picking was  never in dangerous places and it never really scarred bad. The side effects are also minimal.",5
i took this medication and within about 2 or 3 days i was gaining bounds of weight and shaking so violently i could not write. by the 4 week mark when there was absolutely no change in my depression i quit and refused to take depression meds anymore. i would prefer to be miserable than have horrible side effect AND be miserable,1
"I have suffered from PTSD for many years. After so long of suffering, I decided to go ahead and give the medicine a try.  Citalopram has definitely made a difference in my life. I felt like a whole new person. Starting off I had a tad bit of a headache, tight jaw, and dry mouth. It lasted about 3 days, that was it. I was moved up slowly therefore I did not experience any bad side effects as starting at a high dose will cause.  I would really recommend citalopram. Everyone around me says how much of a happier person I am, and I am not as afraid of being in crowds as I was before. Very life changing. It feels great not to feel angry, depressed, scared anymore like before.  I am now at 40mg and have been on it for 4 years.",5
,2
Good medication for me . However I had to switch to Bupropion due to the sexual side effects. I also felt somewhat lethargic at times. Lets see how the bupropion compares. Its only been a couple of days though. Despite all this citalopram definately fixed the depression.,3
,2
"I have had major depression for quite some time and have been on citalopram since 09. At first, it was effective since I didnt feel edgy but much more calm. Just recently I have had major side effects like not being able to sleep at night and constantly tired and fatigued, yawning, absolutely no energy to do basic chores. My complete down fall is zero sex drive without being able to reach the big O. It is straining my relationship of 6 years that I hope I can manage until I go see my PCP in a few days. I am not sure what she will switch me to but I hope its a smooth transition and effective. I do not recommend this product",3
,3
"I took Citalopram on and off (admittedly, mostly off) for a few years.  I did believe it did help me at one point.  I resumed taking it because my depression worsened.  I didn't see any affect from the Citalopram but had to stop taking it due to bouts of weakness/dizziness that started hitting me every afternoon.  They stopped when I stopped taking the Citalopram but then I had to deal with the horrible withdrawal symptoms (brain zaps) for weeks afterwards.  Also had very aggravating sexual side effects",3
I was crying constantly but after my first dose I stopped.  I have been taking for three weeks now and feel so much better.,4
"Although this drug help with depression, the effects were short-lived. From the beginning I was unable to sleep. If I did get sleep, it was never more than 3 hours. I'd be awake until complete exhaustion set in and then I'd sleep for 12 hours, when I'd awake feeling more fatigued and run-down than ever. The beneficial anti-depressive aspects of this drug lasted about 10 days, then I started feeling depressed again. I also experienced a lack of appetite, diarrhea, and slight memory loss. The drug did, however, lessen my urge to smoke cigarettes. I do not recommend this medication.",3
I started with 10mg and slowly went up to 20mg and noticed a huge change a month later. This new and great feeling only lasted a couple of months. I started to notice that I was extremely tired throughout the day even if I had a good nights rest. I was napping 2 or 3 times a day if I could. I was also going back to feeling irritated. The doctor raised my dosage to over a month ago and I have not seen a change. Still tired and starting to feel slightly depressed again.   ,4

Felt better when I first started taking but 6 months later it's worse than before. I feel very angry about people that I don't even know. Just feel like I'm really in the dumps. Scares me about the way I feel about people.Never felt this before in my life. Always liked everyone.,2

"I suffered from depression/anxiety in the form of obsessive worrying every day of my life until I started this medicine.  Since I started it 3 years ago, I'm a different person.  I feel in control of my life and emotions.  The only problem I have with this medication is that it affects my sex drive.  I have much less of an interest in sex than I did before.  I haven't decided if it's worth trying a new medicine for that reason yet, since I'm so happy with it otherwise.",5
"My doctor put me on 20ml of this with phentermine so I can lose the 20 pounds I have gained.  After reading how these two drugs should not be taken together, it scared the crap out of me so I will stop it and only continue with the phentermine.  Why would a doctor put me on two drugs that should not be used together?",1

"I necer took depression meds before.  But when my doctor put me on this (started 20mg at night) after a month life was better!  After about a year, The sad thoughts were coming back, (not as they were, but they were there). Doctor up me to 30 mg nightly.  Life is great! I lost about 20 lbs, not bad all the way around!",5

"Just the fact that I care enough to even post this review is amazing.  The first month was difficult.  Tired, trouble concentrating, yawning, and jaw clenching. One by one the symptoms started to disappear.  I feel I can see past today, care about tomorrow. Is everything coming up roses, no, but I can handle everyday life.  I can see the joy of being here and appreciate life.  It was hard going to the doctor to ask for help, but this drug was defintely worth it. Thats what you have to do when your depressed reach out and ask for help. I am so glad I did.",5

"I just started on 10 mg of this drug yesterday evening. I do not notice any side effects yet, maybe dry nose and mouth. I am very worried that this drug will affect my interest in sex. I have a normal happy sex life even though I am sad and anxious at times. I do not like taking medication. I felt I must be depressed because I have the usual financial, relationship type problems that face a lot of people at this time. I just felt that for the last 2 years I can't seem to feel vibrant or cheerful for very long at a time. Maybe a half a day. I have been turning to food when I feel anxious. I have no motivation to go running or dress up to go out. I have been a good friend and daughter, sister. I can't seem to do this without a little help that I hope drug will give me. I will review Citalopram again as I go along in my treatment. ",3
"This drug in conjunction with ""Tramadol"" & ""Cymbalta"", caused severe side effects. I fainted twice in a 8 hr period. After the second episode, I was taken to E.R. via ambulance. I was treated (?) and released.
My P.C.P., the following day, sent me to E.R. at one of our illustrious hospitals here at the Medical Center, Houston. This was the same hospital that put me on this ""Coctail"" to begin with while I was being treated there for 6 1/2 days.I was given Rx's upon release. 7 days later, while at home, I fainted twice in a 8 hour period. Upon release, the second time, I was told to stop taking the ""Tramadol"". In my own opinion, after extensive research on web sites as this one, WebMD, I stopped taking, not only Tramadol, but also Cymbalta and Citalpram - the drug, that in my opinion, caused these serious side effects and could have killed me !",1
"I do not agree with the ""loss of appetite.""  I have actually gained weight on this medication and I have know a few others who have experienced the same side effect. ",4
Very bad results. First two months was great. Chronic pain subsided. Then went into deepening depression.,1

"I have been taking this pill (10mg dose) and I'm 18-19. I have been having depression for 8 years and I had tooken fluoxetine before which made me feel real better, but if i skipped a day or two, it made my depression worsen. With this pill, just starting out, it made me feel so good and all of the sudden, I began to see blurry, began to feel like passing out, loosen in my bowels and I don't know. I prefer to go back to my fluoxetine. ",3

"I started taking Citalopram 40mg daily for depression. I took it for 4 months. The side effects were tough the first 2 weeks but my Dr advised me to give the medication time to work. I was not able to get to sleep, felt tired and drained all day and had bad headaches,didn't want to get out of bed, I was clinching my teeth really bad. I did not feel any change in my depression. In fact I had people telling my I looked depressed.  I was also placed on Lorizapam for anxiety which works great. I continued to take the Citalopram at my doctors advise but I still experienced the same level of depression. After four months on the medication I still have trouble sleeping at night. If I miss a dose i have the worse headache. The biggest issue for me is that it is VERY hard to orgasm if at all. I advised my Dr that the medication was doing nothing for me plus it was interfering with my sex life so she switch me to Venlafaxine 150mg a day. I hope this works better for me. ",3
"I have been against medication my whole life. Finally I tried this for my anxiety, being scared of everything OCD depression and overwhelmed by every thing. I couldn't do much during a day at all. I have to say I think this drug has saved my life and I am so grateful to have my life back. I am on a relatively low dose of 20mg but it has definitely changed things. ",5

ok,4
"I begun to feel depressed, panicky and overall unhappiness due to cancer. I saw positive results immediately when I was prescribed citalopram.",5
It took about 2-3 weeks to take effect but once it did I felt much better. I like the card it comes in as it makes it easier to remember to take the medication. The only side effect I have experienced is yawning tho it is not too excessive. I would recommend this product. ,4
after I take citalopram after a while my hands get shakey tremers is this normal,3

Have not had any episodes since starting but have progressed to a higher dose after 5yrs. will not do without my happy pills!!!!,4

I started taking 20 mg in 2003. During 2008 I was prescribed 1 mg of Clonazepam for restless leg. During the last year i have experienced SEVERE fatigue and EXTREME low blood pressure.  We are talking every day!  Could not walk my dogs without stopping every 10 feet and bending over so I wouldn't pass out. Body felt like dead weight all day. I stopped Citralopram and noticed a marked improvement in my tiredness..I am still on Clonazpam but have reduced the dosage. Going to try zoloft and see how that works..been depressed  over physical reactions and other thing. I am 69. Don't take this stuff!!! My mental health doc wanted to increase it to 40mg...I said no and stopped it!,3
i feel more depresed now than before,2

"I started taking 20 mg while I was pregnant, to help with the SEVERE moods. I had never been on medication before but suffered with depression for about 10 years. also- anxiety, social anxiety, and possibly pmdd. Everything was great in the beginning but slowly wasn't  as effective. After I had the baby and quit breastfeeding, I decided to go up to 40 mg. I wasn't sure if it was just hormones. Now i'm irritable and agitated frequently (let me note that my son is a Happy baby!), I have no concentration, I can never get enough sleep whether its 6 or 10 hours, and my sexual desire is long gone. And once again, I'm back to my emotional breakdowns. I can't even hold my composure at work anymore :(  I'm gonna try going back down to 20 mg. If that doesn't work, i'm gonna have to switch.. ",3
"I have been taking 40mg/day for 3 years, and it has been effective. I haven't had any side effects, and it has not affected my libido. I find that I have to up my dosage to 50mg/day from October to April due to SAD, and it has been a satisfactory solution. I am switching to Effexor this year due to the new dosage warnings, and for this reason only.",5

"I have been on citalopram for 5 or 6 yrs. Works fairly well to help with depression, but in the last few yrs. i noticed hair loss.  Don't know if it's a side effect or my hormones changing.  Anyone else on this drug experience hair loss??  Pretty significant actually.",4
"Started taking 10mg due to sadness from grieving and alcohol abuse (3-7 drinks/day). On the plus side, the meds have definitely eased the urge to drink. The down side is I have headaches every single day. Hard to say whether they are due to alcohol withdrawal or citalopram, but taking Tylenol eases the pain. It has made me slightly constipated, I was hoping to lose weight since I cut out the alcohol, but I've stayed the same. The worst side effect is that I'm tired all the time! I feel like I'm walking around in a fog and am totally un-motivated to do anything above the bare minimum. ",4
"I am happy most of the time.  My depression
is caused from hormonal inbalance. Menopause.",5
this medication has helped with my depression. I have been in remission for over 6 months.,4
"Originally prescribed 20mg/day I found I could get nothing done on that high a dosage.  Since my mother was chronically depressed her whole life and so was her mother I decided to stay on the drug and lower the dose to 10mg/day.  Eureka!  Smoothed out my emotions and lets me feel normal. I have a low tolerance for drugs so this seems to be a more than adequate dosage to alleviate my symptons.  Less can be more. I have been taking this for over 5 years and I am just starting to have sweating and insomnia issues that are not menopausal. I shower more and read alot to get sleepy.  I have had problems with rashes when I don't hydrate effectively and wear poyester clothing. Easy fix, drink more, wear cotton and stay cool. Overall this drug does the job that Zoloft couldn't. ",5
"I was put on 10 mg of this drug, meaning to increase to 20 after a week (it was to be taken right before bedtime because of drowsiness).  I stopped taking it after 5 days.  I was prescribed this medication in order to combat grief symptoms and anxiety after the death of both of my parents.  I had high hopes, as I had never been on an anti-depressant and was hoping this might make me feel like ""me"" again so that I could do everyday activities without getting stressed and exhausted.  It did improve my quality of sleep and I woke up refreshed and energized, but I would ""crash"" later in the day, a few hours before I was to take my next dose.  It was how I imagine a drug user's ""highs"" and ""lows"" to be, on a milder level.  I had compulsive suicidal thoughts on this medication, and because of this I probably should have told someone I was taking it (I meant for my use of this drug to be private).  Nothing I would act on, but the compulsive thoughts were there.  After having one, I remember thinking to myself, ""woah, I can't believe I just thought that.""  I was almost more anxious on this med and the boomerang effect on my mood was just too much.  May work for some, but not for my particular case.",2
"Works extremely well on me, but have noticed increase in appetite.  I want to graze all day long and seem to be gaining weight. I am also clenching and grinding teeth mostly at night. ",4
"I have been taking citalopram for approximately 3 years. I am currently taking 80mg which has been very helpful with my depressive symptoms. This dose also helps with my anxiety.

No sex drive (not able to reach the big ""O""), tired all the time, no ambition to clean the house.  I finally hit rock bottom and stayed in bed for days, not taking any medication at all, until my husband had me commited.

I have been taking Citalopram for over a year now.My doctor had switched me because for about 10 years I had been taking Fluoxetine (Prozac) and didn't feel it was effective anymore.One bad side effect of this medication has to do with sex.Males might want to take note.You can achieve an erection and have sex for very long periods of time.BUT you might not climax all the time or very rarely.This occured with my girlfriend and myself.I saw my doctor yesterday and he said it was definately the Citalopram causing me not to climax.He also told me that this drug is also used for men who have pre mature ejaculation problems.So that solved my mystery. So if any men out there are having this problem.It's not you it's the medication.I had always climaxed everytime I had sex before I started taking this medication.With me I have to consider changing my medication.My girlfriend is getting pissed and doesn't understand the side effects.,3

Yet, after a year of being on this medication, I have noticed that I don't enjoy anything in my life and all of my relationships are slowly deteriorating.  This medication has also made me extremely tired, lose focus at work, and gain over 40 lbs in the past year-this is very uncharcteristic since I only gained about 1 to 2 lbs a year before taking Citalopram.  After a major spell of depression while being on citalopram, I decided to ask my doctor to change my medication. I am now taking Wellbutrin for only 2 days so far and already feel better and more hopeful about life(dr. said Wellbutrin is an NDRI which affects the brain differently than SSRI meds like Citalopram).  I hope the Wellbutrin works.",1
A lot more cheerful with a sunny disposition as if I was a child with no worries again BUT my memory is not sharp as it was. My abiltiy to have an orgasm is decreased but lots of water can fix that and a little nausea in the morning other than that this has really worked for me.,5

"Dr. prescribed this drug for anxiety and depression, and it works great. I started with the usual 10 mg. Seemed to have good result in first couple of days. Then the usual increase to 20 mg (minimum therapeutic dose) after a week. 10 days after upping the dose I had been doing well but had 3 very 'down' days. Called the Dr., he upped the dose to 40 mg.
Had myriad of side effects at this point, including blurry vision, yawns, increased sexual desire, daytime sleepiness, night time insomnia, among others. Most were fairly mild (I can live on 4-5 hours of sleep if the trade off is feeling this OK) and passed after 2 to 4 weeks at 40 mg. Increased sexual desire is a good thing, I had NONE before. Girlfriend is much happier now.
I have had depression and anxiety my whole life. I had never sought treatment as I felt that I was 'dealing with it' effectively on my own. Boy was I ever wrong. I should have done this 40 years ago. Can't remember EVER feeling this good!

I began taking 20mg once per day and it helped but not completely. My doctor upped my dose to 40 mg once per day and it has definitely taken care of my depression and stress issues. When I began taking it I got the shakes a little bit, but that ended after 3 days and I have had no problem since. It is definitely a miracle drug for my problems. 
On a second note, my daughter (26) began taking this for anxiety - 20 mg twice per day. It caused the shakes to start out with which went away, but then her hands, wrists, ankles and lips swelled up. It was the citalopram which caused these problems. So, two different results within our same family. She would probably tell you to stay away from it. I say it works perfectly, but please be careful. First sign of a side effect, call the doctor.",5
"I have been taking 20mgs of citalopram once a day, everyday since January. I developed a itchy rash on my arms and legs. Ive gone to my doctor several times about the rash and they dont know what the rash is. I came home and looked up ""allergic skin reations to Citalopram"". Well thanks to the web and people's testimony about this drug, I now know where the rash came from.... CITALOPRAM!!! Other than the rash though, I feel great!!! I am a lot happier and more focused at work. My sex drive hasnt increased or decreased. Tomorrow morning Ive got to make a call to my doctor and let them know I've found the source of my rash. All those years in med school and they couldnt figure out the source of my rash!!! That really ticks me off that I had to research my symptoms to get the answer. Even though this rash is rare when it comes to taking citalopram, I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone.",3

In additon, I was tired much of the time. I have decided to not take anymore anti depressants as most all of them have sexual side effects. I am not that depressed & have managed for 60 yrs. I probably should not have started these meds. I have not met anyone who had anything good to say about these drugs. I do not know anyone who was severely depressed. Can I stop taking my 10 MG all at once or do I have to cut down to 5 MG 1st? ",1
my only comlaint is that I've put on almost twenty pounds while on the medication .,4
"I started taking 20mg Citalopram a few months into my freshman year of college because the stress from the new environment and new everything caused me to fall into a deep depression. I started feeling much better within a couple of weeks, but it does make it hard to sleep. I was then given another medication for insomnia, but that just made me tired all the time, so now I just try to get along with a little tossing and turning before I can fall asleep most nights.
I've been wanting to get off of my meds for a while now, but it's been a struggle because I've become so dependent on them (as happens a lot with SSRIs like Citalopram, or at least so I've read). I halved my dosage to 10mg about 2 months ago and tried stopping them once, but I just started slipping back into a deep depression.
Citalopram definitely helped me get back the ability to get up in the morning and get things done, but it's a bitch to try to get completely off of it and to feel 100% normal again.",4

"I started taking this medication at 20mg with 75mg of amitriptyline at night to combat depression and anxiety. After 3 weeks on the medications I overdosed on both, trying to kill myself. I had to be taken off amitriptyline due to the effects that tricyclic antidepressants will have on my body after my overdose, i was put on 25-75mg trazodone as needed at night, and my citalopram dosage was increased to 60mg daily. So far I have been pretty content on this medication, however I am not sure if that is due to my life changes I have made since the episode. Trazodone is also wonderful for helping me get to sleep. If you are on this medication, DO NOT forget a dose. I forgot a dose one day, met with my therapist later that day and when I got home I was so distraught and upset and couldn't really understand why I was bawling. I also recently started hitting myself when I get upset and I had never done that before I took this medication.",3

I have kids and knew that life couldn't continue as it was. I started at 10 mg and just recently after two years I now take 20 mg. Lately I feel very tired and thirsty all the time.

"After a tragic suicide, I began to experience horrible anxiety, OCD and depression. Citalopram (celexa) was first prescribed to me in 20mg, but later proved to be too much and I dropped down to 10mg/once a day. This medicine has worked wonders. At first, the side effects outweighed the benefits but I stuck through it. I gained about 10 lbs. But I'm happy, and hopeful. Took about 4-6 weeks to fully see benefits. I've been on it over a year now and continue to take it, no side effects anymore.

Side of affects keep me from taking as much as I should ,2
I take 40 mg and also take simvastatin. Has anyone else experienced an interaction between these two meds?,3
Life saving...,4
"I have been on this medication for a little over 2 years and my doctor prescribed it for major depressive disorder. For the most part, in conjunction with other drugs, I have been able to stay on top of my depression. ",4
"I have been on this med for three months.  It started out with headaches which are over. lack of sleep, which is over. I had no preconcevied notion on how the pill was going to work. An explaination would have been nice on what I might experience.  I am happier than I was.  I still get sad. I still cry.  But that is what a normal human being would do.  It is supposed to make you function as a normal human with emotions. I am a better person on this drug.  Started on 20mg then increased it to 30mg.  much better for me.",3
does this cause mild stomach pain?,3
"I started this medication 4 weeks ago on 20mg. Today I don't know if it is the meds but I had some energy. I started cleaning everything but at the same time felt tired. The Doctor is going to up the dosage do you think this well help. I have severe depression,anxiety and A.D.D",1
this mediciand has made me more down then i was at first plus gave me real bad headackes the day after. did not like this feeling at all.,1
"The sexual side affects are very apparent.  If it were not for that issue, this drug has worked very well for me.",4
"This medication gave me terrible side effects; I stopped eating, threw up daily, it made me dizzy, kept me awake at night, and I would shake constantly. The side effects were not worth what the drug could potentially do for me.",1
,3
i feel extremely tired and at times extremely gittery,4
I have taken this drug for about 2 years and have not noticed much change other than being able to handle stress a little easier. ,3
I haven't seen any differents I'm still feel down and find myself crying at work and home. ,1
"Switched from Cymbalta to this (because of cost), but it did not control my depression the way Cymbalta did.  It took a while to figure out, because the symptoms did not manifest in the way I was used to (was more angry and irritable than sad and weepy).  Also allowed my fibromyalgia pain to get way out of control too.",1
My doctor saw the depression and suggested medication with counseling.  I thought this over for about 2 weeks then agreed to both.  It has helped tremendously.  Circumstances haven't changed but this medication has helped tremendously to deal with life more level-headed.,5
"9 days into 20 mg and all is well.  The edge is gone and feel so much better.  Starting up again was tough the first few days but taking in the morning and working through the side effects have worked for me.  I am thinking more rationally, positive, and renewed interest in life.  ",4
,3
Just started taking again after being off of it last summer.  I cant wait for the intial side effects to subside.  Seems harder this time but that might be because I know what to expect.  Probably should not have stopped in the first place because it worked great for me.  ,4
,4
"Took me from suicidal to serenity.  I don't have to face those dreadful early morning wake-up periods, when I could neither get up nor stay in bed.  For me, a wonder drug.  Almost never experience the morbid state any more. Seldom think of suicide any more....Got rid of my ""Suicide kit"" ..(sufficient drugs to do the trick.)",4
"Depression has eased, I don't cry as easily. I have been able to cope with the problems we are dealing with a little better. I take it at night and sleep very well, though have had some weird dreams and woke up yelling. When I took it in the mornings, I couldn't function, I was in a fog. I don't have as much jaw tightening taking it at night.  Still feel down though not as much, but am dealing with problems that are downers, can't change the problems. Everyone sees an improvement in my moods and are glad that I finally went to the doctor. Actually the doctor picked up on the depression and is helping me get along with life in an easier manner.",4
"I have been taking this drug for over 6 months now along with Welbutrim that I have been on for 10 years.  What a difference the addition of the Citalopram made!  I feel like myself again!  I have a tendency to have migraines but this medication has not made me have headaches.  I take it at night and sleep very well.  With prayer and Citalopram, my home is a happy place now!",5

"I struggle with depression and anxiety.  I started on 10mg about four years ago and within the first couple of weeks felt much better.  It worked great for about 8 months, but have had to regularly increase dosage over the last 4 years.  I didn't notice any side-effects until I was up to 40mg.  Then I started experiencing decreased libido and slight weight gain.  I've now been on 60mg (the maximum dosage) for four months and during this time have gained nearly 25 pounds, have no libido, and have horrible acne on my back.  And, the increased dosage hasn't helped my depression or anxiety.  I also was camping in the jungle in Central America and forgot to bring enough Celexa with me.  I was without it for about 4 days and the withdrawal was HORRIBLE.  I was dizzy and confused and my face went numb!  Overall, it worked wonders at first, but now am exploring other options and can't wait to get off of it!  I would not recommend taking more than 40mgs - it had no positive impact on me, and numerous studies I've read have indicated that this is usually the case.  If you're on 40mg and feel like you need to increase your dosage, talk to your doctor about switching meds!",3
"I have been on Citalopram for 10 months now. I noticed a change the first week! I was feeling mellow and nothing bothered me. Of course the effect lessened after some time; I am much more patient, however things still bother me. I mean it's not a magic pill, so let's not expect it to solve our EVERY issue. ",5
"Alot of headaches, sweating. Been on it now for over 2 months and am thinking about going back to something else. Didn't really help with anxiety, or my depression. It is cheaper than Lexapro but not as effective for me.",2
"Been taking Citalopram 20mg once daily for almost 4 years now. It has been a life saver. All the same stress and problems are present in life, I am just able to step back and breathe, make a decision on how to productively handle it and move on. Doesnt make me ""high"" or change who I am....just takes away the overwhelming anxiety and allows me to function.",5
good results,3
"I've been taking this medication for about 7 months now. I love it! I was depressed, angry and withdrawn from everyone around me and would bite someones head off without any provocation. I also worried about every little thing. After taking it for a month I started to feel better and mellowed. It's hard to get me angry now and the depression is gone and I don't worry about much of anything. Have gained 10 lbs recently but started working out and lost most of it and feel better too! Weight gain is only an issue if you let it be and choose to sit around and not work out and eat healthy. Can't reach a climax very easily, but solved my pme problem and that's a good side effect for me! There is no shame in taking it, I put it off for too long and regret it now. Life is so much better and everyone can stand to be around me again and I them. I've found I'm actually a fun person since taking this. Just take it! Wake up in the morning, take the pill and forget about it. Only warning I have is, take it everyday! If you don't you and everyone around you will know that your not on it! After a couple days without due to forgetting to take with me on vacation, I was back to my old self in full force. Don't let all the discouraging comments on this site sway you. Try it for a couple months and see what happens, if  you like it keep it, if not then try something else. But you have to give it time, it will not work over night! A month and a week was how long it took for me. Yeah I could feel something after two weeks but really noticed and started getting comments on my attitude after a month. ",5
"This drug makes me feel great mentally!!!  My major side effect is clenching my teeth. When I was upped to 1 and 1/2 pills I broke my tooth and have TMJ syndrome.  Dr. switched me to Lexapro........made me feel horrible mentally.  I'm back on Citalopram but 1 pill now and clenching isn't too bad and feel mentally great again.  I take it around 8pm, sleep like a log and am refreshed upon waking.   Have lost 4 pounds which I didn't need to lose.  I took Zoloft years ago and it made me a zombie and gained 15 pounds on it.  I highly recommend Citalopram but most drugs work differently on each person.  Report your symptoms to your Dr.  Dosage can make the difference.",5
"Been on Celexa for about a month now.  The first week of taking this medication was very hard for me.  I would take it in the morning, like 7am...And it made me very lethargic and tired.  My mouth became extremely dry and every time I would yawn, it felt like i could faint or like a weird floating feeling...Very strange....But the sexual side effects are great...Increased sexual stamina.  I cant seem to climax very easily.  The side effects are not as extreme anymore.  My temper is much better, and I tell my wife and kids ""I love you every day now....Going to stick with it....THUMBS UP!!!",5
Depression & anxiety sucks but my med makes it easier to cope,3
The drug seemed to help right away but after day three I had to stop taking it because of persistent headaches and tiredness.   I would take a pill before going to bed and always wake up aroudn 2 am with a bad headache like a wine hangover or something.,4
"Loss of wife 5 yrs ago to cancer, still having crying spells.Thought it was a weakness to have to take meds.On day 8(citalopram 20mg).Dry mouth, stomach upset, & tired-feeling but will hang in there. Seems helping somewhat.",3
"Sweating side effects at the beginning (1st 2-3 months). I played around with dosing: taking 1/2 a dose 2xs a day, full dose in AM ; full dose pm. Now I take a full dose in the AM after eating ( never on an empty stomach. My depression is gone. I have had no side effects except for the sweating at the beginning. my teen age son notices when I forget to take it, so I think it is extremely effective. I no longer yell out of frustration  and am generally calmer and more tolerant.",5
i've recently had problems because my pharmacy has supplied me with 3 different types of the same generic.,4
"I've been on 20 mg for a month.  It replaced Pristiq, which stopped working.  The first 2 weeks i was very irritable, that's tapering off now.  I've been severely/dangerously depressed since i was 16.  I've been on so many anti-depressants that didn't help me, that i lost count.  

This drug has made me ""feel"" HAPPY, which i can't remember the last time I did..  I was suicidal and gave up hope of ever feeling/feeling happy again before this drug. 

I STRONGLY recommend it! being irritable and short-tempered for 2 weeks is a small price to pay for feeling hopeful and excited to start living my life with smiles, laughter, ambition, and a future.",4
"it dropped my blood sugar, i have never had sugar issues in my life. i only wiegh 105lbs. i now have to take insulin shots.it sent me to the emergency room with a bloodsugar of 650 thats coma state for some .",1
I have had severe constant headaches with this drug.  It is not doing very well for me.,2
"When I tried to wean myself off the citalopram, I noticed my hot flashes came back in full force.  The dr. told me that citalopram also helps with menopausal symptoms.  I ended up increasing my dosage, per his request, and I've been very happy",5
"Tiredness,lack of motavation,forgetfulness, just can,t be bothered, nightmares confusion a mix up with monthley cycle, late or not at all, does it haelp or work I do not know/ for me the change is very little,40mg three months now.",2
"In the beginning a bowel movement a couple times a day,trouble swallowing a little bit for about an hour after taking but not bad, after taking for awhile the difference can be told if it works or you feel you need a higher dose.",3
"This treatment has enabled me to ""calm down""...I generally am a typical Type A personality...constantly worrying about others, giving myself and time to others and not taking any time to reflect on myself. Noticed that I was becoming obsessive and letting even minor things such as ""spilled milk"" send me over the edge.  Described all to my doctor and after beginning this in July, I feel calmed, without feeling sluggish.  I just take things more ""with a grain of salt"".",4
"Works Very Well, I Have Been Able To Deal With .",5
"gave me headaches so bad I needed to be hospitalized, even being on it about 2 weeks gave me memory loss, loss of appetite and sexually useless, as well as mood swings
this drug was a very bad experience and I dont recomend it to anyone. the risks far out balance the benifits, as it even began to affect my liver funtion and vision. there are many more drugs out there that do a better job than this with far less serious risks, after being hospilized due to this drug, I was shocked to read the list of side effects, and even 2 weeks in, I was experiencing common and uncommon side effects, who knows what would have happened if I were to remain on it. I can not recomend this drug for anyone taking Concerta while on this drug or trying to replace Paxil WITH this drug.",1

"i was on Welbutrin for 2 yrs before- which didnt work for me. i begged my DR for something diff but he said ""just give it time"" so I got a new Dr and she put me on this. thus far so good... it's been a few weeks. i felt an immediate mood change and mind lift. i dont freak out or go off, and i can smile when i think about life and the future. :) and thats def a good thing. :)",4
"I've been on citalpram for three years and this summer I slowly eased of them from 60mg to none in three months. I wanted to see what I was really feeling with out the drug. (I did this with my doctors okay). I can't belive what a differnce it was with out it, and not in a good way! All the bad feelings came back, teeth ginding, social fears, and the depression sliding back fast,and  bad dreams again. I'm back on it again, at 20mg, and can't wait for the dose to be upped again, next month. I was so surprised what the meds were doing, and they were helping, I just didn't know how much.

I started useing the Citalopram HBR  and I get sleeping again and I'M asleep for couple hours then when taking just Citalopram itself I am fine and awake for the rest of the day I talk to my doctor and suggested to stop taking the HBR and remain on citalopram was ther a diffrence he said the HBR is used mostly to relax the brain rather it be active the medicine is used only at night well I am not happy how this med makes me feel. ,4
"I have been on this (along with Xanax for my anxiety) for about 2 months and have seen definite improvements. I'm currently on take 20 mgs, doctor might bump me up to 30 or 40 mgs once winter sets in. I feel great and side effect have been minimal. ",5
Definitely feeling better after 2 months but had to switch my dosage to evenings so I could sleep.  After 1 additional month my headaches are subsiding and I am sleeping much better,4
"When Medco decided they wouldn't pay for my lexapro any longer, they switched me to citalopram and I'm, again, crying all the time. I NEVER cried on Lexapro.",2
"I had very bad depression. I would bite everyones head off, then run off and cry and hate myself. It caused my marriage to end. Now I am doing great. No side effects except being sleepy. One benefit for me was my sex drive! I am always ready to go. Before I just went thru the motions. Now I am very happy.",5
Post pardum depression,4
"I call this my kill pill...If i go without for a few days, I'm screaming, yelling, and just can't get control of myself. Since I have taken this medicine for several years, I would never stop it. My doctor says I have an imbalence in my brain, I also have had seizures for more than 50 years, but they are under control.",5
"4/5 on effectiveness and satisfaction only because I have never before taken any anti-depression medications whatsoever and have never taken any since I discontinued use of this particular medicine.

Walked around with my head down until I started this medication and immediately noticed myself engaging in conversation almost involuntarily because of how seemingly strange conversation was after being afflicted by my condition.

Had a smile on my face and stayed level-headed and task/goal oriented.

Would resume use of this medication.",4
within the first month of taking this I could tell a big difference - family also noted a difference in my moods and behaviors. It has been easy to take with minor side effects of sleepiness (I can only take it at night before bed or I am tired and napping most of the day).,5
"Have been taking this 8 days, this time. Tried it several months ago, and it made my anxiety unbearable. This time, am taking half a pill, and noticed improvement in my mood immediately. Am no longer easily upset, angry, and constantly sad. Have not noticed any side effects. Feel like I should, able to deal with life now. Sleep patterns are unaffected so far. One day at a time!",4
I have been taking this med for over a year. It has helped greatly with the depression but for the first part of the day I feel zonked. Cant seem to get fully awake until around 10 or so. Also have noticed over this time period I have gained around 16pounds. I have never gained that much weight in a year!,4
"Was on this med for 8 mo's. Took away the depression, but I felt tired all the time.
Could no wake up in the morning and had no desire to do anything.",3

"After 3 years I am somewhat satisfied.  I no longer suffer from ""social anxiety"" at work and can confront the issues that arise without bursting into tears.  BUT I don't have the desire to cope with much else or resume the things that used to bring me great joy.  Obligations and maintaining friendships do not intrest me...in fact nothing much intrests me anymore.  This helps me function and be a useful member of society but does not restore my joy.  ",3

"I dont feel as sad as often as before and i dont experience any major side effects only tiredness which is possibly due to depresion itself.However i have noticed my facial hair and hair seems to be growing rapido,i wonder if this is due to citralopram",4
I take 20mg daily and it works good for depression and anxiety. I enjoy life again and I can handle everyday ups and downs.,5
Im not as sad as before even though I still find myself crying for no reason but not as bad as before. I dont want to end my life anymore and that feels good. But I dont like that I feel tired ALL the time. I get 8 hours of sleep at night yet I feel exhausted from the moment I get out of bed till the moment I get back in it. I hope this goes away. Ive only been on this med for 2 weeks. ,3
"although it has helped enourmously with my depression and anxiety (i finally feel like a normal person) I find it impossible to sleep with this medication, while before i was getting a sound 8 hours, I now only get 4-5 hours of restless sleep, and thats with sleeping pills!",5
i have gained weight on this medicine.,3
"I had been taking Paxil for 13 years and it just wasn't helping me anymore. I had anger issues,major depression, crying for no reason and horrible thoughts. I did not want to be around my loved ones, sometimes not even myself. Since taking this medicine I have not been as depressed, and the anger has subsided. I know it is going to take a little bit of time for it to completely start working but so far I am happy with the results will be happier once the tiredness goes away. If you are taking and anti-depressant or think you need one ask your Dr. about this medication.  ",4
This drug has made me feel a lot better.  Have problems with depression and also agitation/anger issues.  Since I have been taking this medication I don't fly off the handle like I use to and I don't just sit around in a blah state of mind. I take it at night because it does make me sleepy but I had rather deal with being sleepy than snapping at my loved ones in anger and being depressed.  Also before I started this medication I constantly woke up every 2 or 3 hours and I could never remember my dreams but now I sleep through the night and I can remember my dreams. My dreams are really random and vivid.  Overall I feel much better especially when I go to bed at a reasonable hour and get plenty of sleep.  I have tried several different medications but this one is the best so far.,5
it takes my mind off alot of raceing thoughts i rest so muchbetter at night it meloies me out,5
"Been taken this medication for depression. Depression has gotten somewhat better, but the side effects are causing me great difficulty.  Always tired, weak and unable to sleep.  Doctotr says side effects should start to go away in a couple of weeks.  I hope so.  I want to get better, but I will have to stop taking this medicine if the side effects do not go away, for I am unable to function with no sleep.  Other side effects nausea, headaches, and food cravings.  Good outcomes, more emotionally even, not crying as much, not so much despair.",3
"I noticed the awful thoughts disappeared but I'm always tired during the day! I now drink caffeine and I never used to before. I also have trouble sleeping at night, which seems odd. My dreams are really weird - feels like I'm watching a movie someone else turned on. Doesn't feel like me. I've been waking up after about 4 or 5 hours of sleep which is not enough. Thinking of asking doctor for an alternative. This is my first experiment with drug therapy. Been taking it for 3 months. ",3

"Took a while to work, but when it did my depression completely abated.  Side effects did happen, but I kept taking it and am very happy that I did.  I have to take an extra med for anxiety.  Despite its off-label use for panic disorders, it didn't help for that.",5

They are terrible dreams in which people are dying and its a matter of survival.

"My grandmother has alzheimer's and she experienced every side effect that is described by the drug definition. Agitation, suicidal thoughts, paranoia and shakiness.",1
"I have been taking this generic form of Celexa for ten years, next month. I was hesitant about getting on any mood med, but it has helped me tremendously. I am here writing this review... that's the point, I'm here. Diagnosed with major depression at 19, I was prescribed this pill by my family physician after several doctors visits relating to depression and its toll on my mind and body. It took me a while to loose some of the edge of being depressed all the time, but the fact is, I did loose the edge. Not perfection, but hey, no one is perfect. But I know that when I stopped taking this med, I relapsed into another major depressive episode. Went back to the med after 6 months of being utterly miserable all the time, and started improving within months. It takes months, realize, for this particular medicine to show its benefits to the user. Others see results sooner than you will; remember, when you're truly depressed everything is gray. If the roof fell on you you wouldn't care. That's depression. By the time you've realized that you need to see your doctor, make the appointment, actually GO and discuss what you're going through... you have already put your body and mind through so much stress OF COURSE the med won't be an instant cure-all. To the reviewers who've been on this pill for only five days or not long at all, WAIT before submitting your reviews. I am here to testify that without this medicine (the ONLY medicine or supplement I take), I wouldn't have been here today writing this really, really long post. 

Seek help. If this pill doesn't work after six months I would advise you to actively find alternatives with the help of your physician and your physician alone. Not a friend. Not a TV commercial or magazine ad. A real doctor. 

Believe me, you will go crazy (crazier?) trying to piece together all the med jargon you googled online. Hope this helps some one out there in internet land.

I've been on this for 5 days now and I discovered I can't climax.  Erection is fine but results are extremely frustrating for myself and my wife.  I'll be talking with my doctor early next week about finding another drug.  I started taking this drug because of work related stress and depression.  The one great thing about my life and what helps hold me together is my marrige.  For me this drug isn't worth the side effects.  If you weren't depressed before you sure would be after taking this drug.,3

this is the only antidepressant I have used that still allows me to enjoy sex. Paxil worked better for me depression-wise but I couldn't orgasm. So the citalopram is my choice. ,4
"I used to take Lexapro, but because of loss of medical insurance was swithched to Citalopram. Which I was told was as close to Lexapro as you could get.  I didn't read any of the side effects until recenctly when I started displaying impulsive sexual behaviour.  This is the only side effect that I have noticed. But is a concerning one.",4
"I have been taking this medicine since March 2008. It is the most effective one I have ever taken for overall depression, mood swings, bad anxiety, and bipolar disorder. It keeps me chilled out so I can relax and be myself, and not panicky and irrational like I can be when it gets bad. Different medicines work for different people, but after Zoloft, Paxil, and Effexor not doing it for me, this was a godsend. I am not advertising for this medicine, this is just what works for me. I recommend to anyone who has any or all of these symptoms to not lose hope and keep an open mind to medicine when therapy isn't enough. If the first or the next rx doesn't work, be patient and keep trying-everyone has a formula that will help make their lives liveable again.",4
,3
I have been taking this for the last 6 months now and I actually feel like myself now! There was a time where I would think I was going crazy and be in a really bad mood for no reason at all and now I don't feel like that at all!! I would recommend this medication to anyone and the only side effects that I have noticed was seeing something run across the floor when there is nothing there. I can deal with that rather than my husband wanting to smack me(lol) for being so moody! ,5
"edges and depressed ,under alot of strss in house.",5
its good for me when i remember to take it. ,4
It has really helped with my depression.  I am not depressed at all anymore.  For the first month I experienced nausea and headaches but not anymore.  I ran out of pills for a week or so and experienced extreme depression and anxiety attacks.  So just make sure you don't run out!,4

still have depression,3
it is somewhat helpfull,3
"Went from being suicidal to an even tempered, somewhat serene patient.  Still suffering greatly from spinal stenosis, gout, trigger finger and arthritis.  Also suffeering to dry mouth resulting from throat radiation for Lymphoma/throat. Attending a very good pain clinic.",5
too many side effects,1
i`v found it hard for me to think and say what i`m thinking at the same my brain is slow and i`m having panic attack at times,3
,3
Citalopram is a small easy pill to take each day and it has totally brought me out of a slump that I have been experiencing in my life at age 54.,4
I no longer can take this drug because it may react on the central nervous system because I have to take Percocet or Vocodin for severe back pain. I will be having back surgery in two or three weeks and I've reduced the amount I take.  Also I believe this drug has cause severe hair loss in the past 6 months because I've taken it for so long.,3
I have been using this drug for about 1 year and have not experienced any side effects. This is a wonder drug for me!,5
I felt the difference very shortly after taking the medication.  The only bad thing I have seen is when I have forgotten to take it a few times I can tell because I start getting lightheaded and dizzy.,4
I have been on med for over a year and had great results. Very little sexual side affects. I do want to sleep more than normal.,4
When first starting my med I experienced very bad headaches.  I gradually got used to it but every so often if i dont take it on time i start getting a slight headache ,5
"I have been on this med for about 9 months..I take at night due to sleepiness.  Huge difference in how I feel...really works!! Side effects I have are yawning, night sweats, and I am a little forgetful now...my husband says thats okay he will take the new me over the old me anyday!!!",5
" Able to sleep soundly at night and stopped having horrific dreams.  This drug may cause optical/visual problems and impair driving ability?

",4
So far only 2 effects...lots of yawning during daytime and achy muscles. Hope this goes away with time. Other than that it is perfect.,5
"I had been on Prozac for years but wasn't helping. So switched to Lexapro which seemed to help. But because of it being expensive, my doctor recommended Citalopram which has worked wonders. Not only has depression (almost) disappeared, so has anxiety. (Which was still present w/Lexapro)

I read a previous comment about seeing things running across the floor but nothing there. I have a similiar problem (although very infrequenly) where I see something move from the corner of my eye. Nothing there either.
But hey .... If due to the medication, 
I sure can live with that.",4
It helped in the beginning. I felt a lot better. then it feels like it quit working.,2
"Wondering if anyone had negative effects after stopping this med?  I started w/ 20 mgs and increased to 40 mgs.  I ran out and didn't get it refilled about a week ago and am experiencing major fatigue and spells of lightheadedness.  Other than that this works great for me except for now when I am without it.  The worst side effects I experienced were lots of yawning (I switched to taking it at night and it solved this) and loss of sex drive, which sucks but can be dealt with. ",4
"I have been on the 20 mg for a while now and i feel like my normal self again, but i saw the doctor on the 12th and he asked me how the medicine was working, I told him it's been alright i don't feel it though and the doctor said you are depressed and put me on the 40 mg. It's been 6 days and i can't function at all the 40 mg's knock me out within 15 minutes and i can't wake up i want to sleep all day i have to call my doctor because this is way too strong for me the 20's were fine.",4
"I have been taking this drug for nearly a year and it puts a thin veneer of civilization between other people and myself.  I have fatigue, mood swings, excessive weight gain, brittle nails and cannot stand to be around people more than an hour at a time.  I am depressed and wish people would just disappear off the face of the planet so I do not have to deal with them.  When will there ever be a real drug to treat depression??",1
"I have been on citalopram for ayear now , it has worked great for my depression and anxiety the only side effect i have is that i see something running across the floor all of a sudden its nothing i know, but it must be the medication, has this happen to anyone?",5
"Suicidal thoughts greatly reduced.  No more ""Black Mornings"", more energy.  Happier.Physical pain much reduced.",4
I have been taking this for about two months and havent noticed too much of a difference...except that I have lost 20 lbs! I really like the fact that this doesnt make you gain weight! We will see if it helps with the depression!,3
,3
"Anger is my worry. I am at the age for change of life and I get angry quickly and 
also seem to forget. Have trouble keeping focused.",3
MEDICATION DO NOT WORK VERY WELL ON MY DEPRESSION. I CANT TELL VERY MUCH DIFFERANCE.,3
"I take 20 mg and feel really good.  I was on Lexapro, but that never made me feel normal, and made me gain too much weight. The weight gain itself would freak me out. Now I can really feel good without the weight gain. I have had no side effects.  It has opened me up and taken away the dark cloud that always seemed to be hanging over my head.  I feel like a new person.",5
,4
"I really like this medication for a couple of reasons: it's milder than a 10 mg Lexapro, it's not expensive, it decreases any unnecessary feeling of guilt, and I haven't had an anxiety attack while on it. Overall, Citalopram is pretty good. I take 20 milligrams each morning but sometimes I feel like I need 30 milligrams in a situation where I feel the onset of an anxiety attack. I've tried to not take it for a day and I find myself feeling extremely nervous, anxious, having feelings of guilt for trivial reasons, and somewhat ""twitchy."" There is a possibility that these are a mixture of withdrawal symptoms and feelings of vulnerability to depression because I know I hadn't taken my medication.  
Another problem I have with Citalopram are the sexual side effects. I feel less sexually driven and an inability to climax on a consistent basis. My last discrepancy with this medication is a mild inattentiveness during conversation and daily tasks. Though these drawbacks are problematic, I will continue to take this medication because I feel like it has given me my life back.      ",4
"Severe withdrawl symptoms.  Dizziness, agression, electrical zaps (systemic).  Take this drug with EXTREME caution.  I stopped the drug by reducing the dose (40 mg/20mg/10mg).....this did NOT help.",4
"I was on this medicine for 6 to 7 months, in the beginning I needed this medicine for depression at 40mg for the first 2 weeks, changes on my mood have been occuring negativly, no sleep, trouble concentrating, etc. I contacted my doctor, and he said to ""give it more time"", so I did. A month later I went from a 137ibs to 152ibs so I contacted my doctor he said this medication does not make you gain weight, he said it was my diet. With total weight gain I went from 137ibs to 175ibs. After reading some of the comments at WebMD I found out that this medication DOES make you gain weight. I stopped taking the medicine cold turkey, I am back on my old medication and my weight is starting to come down. After leaving this medication, I had no more bad ideas but sometimes, I cannot control my eyes, they twitch from one side to the other for a second and it happens when im driving. I dont know if it is some kind of withdraw side effect from the medicine and if this is happened to someone else, PLEASE post a comment, I will be checking regularly.",1
"I have tried other AD and while some worked they had side affects that I could not live with, one made me vomit almost every night. My doctor decided to try Citalopram and I am so glad. I still feel like me but my emotions do not get out of control. My depression seems under control. I have had no side effects and do not feel numb like I did on other AD's.",5
"I started feeling better very quickly.  This drug puts a ""floor"" in my emotions where there had previously been none.  I can still feel — I still get sad and cry, which I'm happy about.  But it's just regular sadness now.  It doesn't plummet me.  I'm more interested in sex than I used to be, and it feels better too.  But my ability to focus has been slightly impaired, and I yawn a whole lot now.  ",5
,5
"When i first started I had some moderate side effects- nausea, head ache, decreased appetite and low sex drive. Everything cleared up within 2 weeks. Now the only side affect is night sweats. Other than that its very effective for helping my depression and anxiety. ",5
"I am a newlywed and have lost ANY desire to even think about sex. Been on many other AD's before, the only one that I think positively about is Prozac. Now I have to decide which is worse, gaining weight or no sex. Hope my husband really loves for who I am cause there's gonna be more to love. ",4

"I was on 20mg for about a year and it didn't seem to be working anymore so my Dr. increased it to 40mg and I am doing just fine now. 
 
 
",5
"I started taking Celexa both for depression and anxiety. It has really been effective for the anxiety, bringing me from about a ""9"" on a 1-10 scale to about a ""3"". However, it never helped with the depression, so my dr. added Wellbutrin. In the beginning with Celexa I had some headaches and nausea but fortunately they went away within a week. ",4
,2
this drug worked for me in 2 hours.  it was life changing.  Additional side effects i have that are not mentioned in the literature:  clenching teeth and less deep sleep.,5
"On it for 2 months @ 20 mg.  Yawn constantly, no difference in mood, bad nightmares (screaming in sleep)and achy pain in shoulders & upperarms with numbness in hands/fingers.  Aso harder to get going in a.m., wake up with slight headache & slight dizziness.  Trying to give it enough time but calling M.D. about it now.",2
"On my second week.  Initial side effects are gone and sleeping great.  I am feeling less anxious, coping with stress better, and even have laughed.  The holidays were tough but it seems to be kicking in.  You have to keep with it and give it a chance to work.  ",4

"On each side of succesful throat cancer treatment, the mornings for me were practically unbearable.  Besides a serious case of extremely painful spinal stenosis,  I would lay in the bed in the AM unwilling to remain abed, but unable to get up, with the blackest thoughts in my head.  
I now joke with my wife that I would never trade this acute pain for a return to depression.

"This has been a wonderdrug for me! Took 6 weeks, but has been amazing. Give it time to work! ",5
"Taking for a week.  No effect on mood though I understand it takes some time so I will stick with it.  Nausea, restless sleep, sweats, and lots of yawning during the day.  First AD ever taken so I really hope it works.  ",1
i felt like my mind was on 2 pots of expresso and the bathroom thing wasn't pleasant. I stopped after 2 weeks.,1
"I have been on this drug for 3 months 2 months on the 20 mg and now a month on the 40 mg. No side effects except for im always tired, and have gained a few lbs. I have no sex drive at all. Is this normal? ",3
"treatment works well for nine months to a year, then the depression comes back even with a dosage change.",4
I have completely lost my sex drive and am always tired! Have come to the conclusion that I need to get OFF of this med a.s.a.p.!,2
Since I started n citalopram I have gained over 15 lbs and I am always hungry.I have never in my life put on weight like this and I am unable to diet.Does anyone else have this effect ?,3
,1
I'm experience numbness in my arms & hands it wakes me up SEVERAL times a night is this normal?,4
"Clear thought patterns, less frequent frustration with shorter duration. The complete removal of headaches that I now know were caused only by depression and no other medical explanation.A good experience overall",4
"After a few weeks on 20MG I was still very depressed so doctor doubled the dose and now having nightmares and sleeping 10 hours a night. Still have depression but a little milder. Doctor says could increase to 60 but afraid I will want to sleep even more.
No interest in sex.",3
"Been on this for a month now.  It is helping me out with my depression.  Im on 20mg once daily tablets.  I've been having some drowsiness with this and having problems getting more than a few hours sleep. This could be a side effect or could be something else. Not sure can't see the dr for another couple weeks.  It has mellowed me out, but the emotions I used to have seem like they try to come out but they just can't, like crying.",3
At first this med made my orgasms more intense. Now it's back to normal.  My penis size has increased. I don't know why this happens but I heard it is common. Overall a good experience.,2
"I took Effexor XR in high school for depression, but unfortunately dealt with an emotional numbness, nightmares, and migraines on that medication and gave up on anti-depressants to pursue hobbies, etc...  About two years ago, the depression came back full force and I asked my doctor to try something new, so she prescribed Citalopram, a generic for Celexa.  It has kept me balanced out without making me feel numb or having any other unpleasant side effects.  Everybody's body chemistry is different, and although effexor didn't do it for me,  this medication keeps me in check beautifully.",5
"I have been on this for 2 weeks half 20mg pill and have no energy, strange dreams at night, more depressed. It does make my mood swings better but I find that I don't really care about anything when I'm on it. The stomach aches are really bad on it. I will try it for 2 months and see what happens. So far nothing is happening on it. ",1
hard to cum...,4
"This drug took a bit more than two weeks for me to respond to it, but all in all it has been good.  I have had very few side effects-mostly I'm more tired, but that could have been other health issues that are ongoing.  I used lexapro before citalopram.  I like lexapro better but because lexapro stopped working I needed a new antidepressant and citalopram is just fine.  ",5

"I feel like this medication isn't helping me at all, just making me very nervous.",1
"I started taking this medication to counteract depression, only to find that it made it worse. I felt extremely weak and dizzy. Try something else.",1
"After tring 3 other drugs, this was the one I could stick with.  I had probablems sleeping at first, but that was cured by taking OTC Melatonin.  I have put a few pounds on, but I think that has been do to my on-the-go mom lifestyle.  My libido actually increased.  My husband is a happy man, too.  I am less stressed, happy and the old me, again.",5
I have taken this med for 3+ years. Previously I was on another kind of anti-depressant which worked well except for the side affects.  This one has been good for me with no side affects except maybe being a little more tired.  I can cope with that.,5
"This med has dramatically improved my quality of life! Despite my loss of libido, it has been worth the sacrifice!",5
"THis is day 4 for me taking this pill. Im trying to think positive but I dont like the way it makes me feel. Im sleepy even after 8 hours of sleep. No enegry, been in bed 2 of the 4 days I been on it cuz I just dont feel like doing anything. I feel sick to my stomach, not hungry, & I just feel ickey. Im gonna try staying on it for 30 days, if there is no change then I will talk to my Dr about switching. UGH!",2

"I have been taking this med for the last year and have been rather happy with its ability to handle my depression, but recently have developed heart palpatations and have had a non-existant sex drive that started about three months after taking it.",4
"I have been on this drug now for a year to treat a combination of depression and anxiety. Tried getting off it because of the weight gain and within a month started to change my mood drastically and had to go back on. Keeps my energy level up, otherwise I am very tired without it.",5
"I've been on this for a year and a half and feel less anxious.  I feel like my mood has completely mellowed and I'm a lot happier.  I had problems at first with tiredness, but I started taking at night and it cured it.  Just watch out, the first few days cause really weird dreams.  ",4
"I have been on this for a year and a half now along with one other med, (which the doc has changed many times). I have had no side effects with this drug. Regaurdless of the other pill. I still have depresstion but not as bad as i did before getting onto ANY meds. My panic attacks are uneffected by this med. My aniety is maybe 20-30% better, regardless of what the other pill is at time in compare to before i took any meds. My father was Bipolar and my doc knowing that says I'm depressed with anxiety. I know we all differ do to bio, so in all i would recomend giving this pill a try. I have had better results with it then many others I was on before it. And so far I'm still on it todate.",2
,4
"This is my first anit-depressant.  I am very pleased with the 20mg.  I have gained 30 pounds in the first 4months so that has made me more depressed than anything.  I have no energy.  I stay tired. I really didn’t think these were side effects to the medicine until reading up on it.  I have minimal sex drive.  I guess I don’t like it, as much now that I realize my lack of energy and desire to go outside on a daily basis may be more of a side effect to the drug.  But, I will say no more crying all day, so I guess you have to take the good with the bad.",4
"This med seemed to work OK for the first few months. But then again, this was the first anti-depressant I've ever taken. Over the course of a little over a year, I gained nearly 40 lbs and completely lost interest in sex and tend to have episodes of insomnia. I honestly wouldn't bother with it.",2
"I was first prescribed Lexapro,and that cause horrible heart palpitations and night sweats.  I was then switched to the citalopram, a very lose dose, it has been a God-send!  I feel so much better, and no heart issues, slight night sweats still, but dealable...dry mouth is very slight and water with lemon works for that.  I could go up in dose, but this is working for me and leaves room to change if needed in the future.",5
"I'm on a very low dose. More even keel, a bit more engergetic, better focused, calmer. Still a little down. Don't want to be a zombie (as with Zoloft) so I try to stay on the low dose and find balance in daily life. The drug has helped me a great deal.",5

felt a lot better,4
i have severe depression. this is my third different kind of pill experience. I had one relapse with this med. and one attempt. but been fine for four days.,3
Started taking for several months. Worked alright at first. Stopped taking after my sex drive went MIA.,2
This works good it keeps the depression under controll.,4
"I have been on this for 1 year. In the beginning seemed to work well. Now I am awake during the night, have absolutely no energy during the day. Andwhat used to be a very active sex life has now vanished.",1
sleep,3
"I was on this medication for 8 weeks. During that time, I was extremely drowsy, all the time, no matter what time of day I took the medication. I am a competitive runner and the meds just ""took the wind out of my sails"". I had no energy or stamina to run. It had minimal impact on my depression but did help with irritability/anger/mood swings. I am going to go back to Prozac, most likely as the side effects for me were minimal.",2
,4
I switched from prozac to citalopram and what a difference! I'm so glad my doctor knew to do this!!! It has turned my mental outlook a complete 180 degrees!,5
"Does this pill make anyone else feel nausea/vomiting issues? I tried to take it twice for my depression but I cannot for the life of me, keep these meds down. ",2
"It's the alternative to Prozac and/or Paxil for me.  This drug works very subtle, one a day in the morning does it.  I tried to come off it twice over the years but noticed the difference within a few days.
It keeps me at an even keel throughout the day.",5
"I like this drug but, it has made me have very very little sex drive it is so bad that is it causing problems in my relationship. ",4
When I started taking the drug it helped but over a peroid of time my depression got worse.  I am now taking Zoloft and it is an execllent drug for my symptoms.   ,1
dont know too soon to tell,2
"Today is my second day taking this.I am very much into holistic health and not pills so I am very concerned about the issue when you all say you cannot come off them.  I am usually a very optimistic, VERY energetic person with a sunny disposition but I am losing my company and having to do bkrpt and very, very depressed about the whole deal, so depressed I cannot even make myself go the attorney to file.  So I asked for a ""helper"" from my doctor.  Today I am so lethargic I cannot stay up for more than an hour, dry mouth, bowel problems, dizzy, unenthused about accomplishing anything but when I try to sleep I feel like all my muscles are tense, have a headache in the back of my mind and generally feel very YUCCKY.  I am hoping that all you people out there saying ""stick with it"" are right, but still I think I will try 1/2, or 10mg tonight and quit taking them in the a.m.  I'm hoping I will be one of you chipper ""these are great"" people.  I had expected something a little less powerful I guess, like after drinking a couple of beers, that smoothness, not all this static. ",2
"I have only been taking this for a few days and I feel a little off, I have no appetite and my mouth feels totally off, all foods and drinks taste bad and even my tongue feels like it's hard to move sometimes even when I'm just talking. I'm trying to stick it out because I've heard good things and hopefully it can help me from going off the deep end. ",2
notices that If dose is missed I get irritated and antsi  Like I am withdrawing from opiates.  Very adictive; but works.,4
"sweating to much which is imbarassing, always feeling like i have to pee",4

I dont keep to myself as much and also seem to do more of my everyday activities as before I did not want to do anything.,5
"I've been on this for two weeks at 10 mg and it has helped me feel calm and think clearly, but I do feel flat, zombie-ish and disconnected. I have also fainted. The most dramatic change has been my sex drive. It went from 100 to zero. I am not interested in sex and I can't climax. I have never had a single problem with this, and this is a very dramatic change. I hope this will go away. I was on wellbutrin a few years ago and it made me anxious and forgetful but I had great sex drive, lots of energy, no weight gain.",3
"I don't like it.  It makes me feel clammy and I can't sleep at night on it.  I am going to quit taking it.

"I do not expreience axiety anymore I am not drowsey during the day I do not have mood swings I take 40 mg at night it also helps me sleep the only side affect that I have experienced is some nausea, I am willing to experience this verses the other symptoms of depression.",4
I have been on this drug for three months and it helped with my mood swings and anger but I gained 20 lbs. It made me very tired through the day when I took it in the morning and didn't seem to last a full 24 hours when I started taking it at night.,3
Just started the treatment.,3
I have tried over about 12 anti-depressants over 20 years and this is the only thing that has proven results for my depression.,5
effective for my symptoms,3
i have been taking citalopram for over a year.it hasnt helped and i have gotten worse i finally told my doctor and she recently switched me to prozac. when on citalopram my anger was bad temper short and got angry for no reason i have put on over 40 lbs and i just didnt need that. i hope this new med works because i am feeling tired and suicidal all the time i just sit in my room and cry i have to hide this from my daughter because she is a natural worrier. she is the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end so if you are taking citalopram watch out for more depression good luck,1

this was a wonderful drug it helped me out alot,5
lost a lot of hair,4
Started this med two weeks ago.The past six days Ive had such bad stomach cramps. Dr. said it's very common and should stop in a couple weeks(I dont know if I can stand it two more weeks)Any one else have that problem?did it stop?,3
"Took it for four days. On the second day, I started to become restless. On the third day, I woke up with a racing heart beat and felt like a nervous wreck. I started to fidget and move uncontrollably. Anxiety continued at an unbearable level. I was really hoping this med would work, but I had a bad reaction to it.",2
weight gain,2
It does cause me drowsiness still but that could be a result of my other drugs as well,4

"Citalopram works for my depression as well as controlling my anxiety.  I have no problems with nightmares, sleep and/or weight gain. Like other similar drugs (Paxil & Prozac) I had to 'up' my dose slowly to avoid headaches.  I now take 60 mg/day. ",5

"I had a mild allergic reaction to this drug.  It was my first experience taking an antidepressant and I ended up in the ER!  Nothing major - my throat felt tight (but was not closing up) and my chest felt a little tight too.  The ER gave me benadryll and let me sleep off the symptoms, and I was fine.  The doctors were very surprised I had a reaction to that; they cannot figure out why.  I have eczema, which they said may have somehow contributed but I have no other medication or food allergies.",1
"Some women between ages 35-45 start to go through a chemical imbalance! For 4 yrs I put my family and myself through hell. Was informed by a close friend of this natural change and how to get help. CELEXA an/or the generic (those of us with no insurance - generic brand - 3 months rx cost me $12 @ Walmart) 

This med. stopped my out of control crying, the angry mood swing and thoughts of ending my life. After about 3-5 wks, myself, family and friends noticed a complete change! Happy again, brain was clear and no bad thoughts.

MY EXPERIENCE: My anti-depression prescription ran out and I lost my insurance. I call my previous dr and/or ;oca; free clinic // inform them of my situation (and I didnt take NO as an answer) and demand a RX from previous Dr and/or emergency appt at clinic (they charge per your income = I didn't have any money at the time and just had the bill for $20 mailed to me - paid them $2 a month until bill was paid) My doctor informed me that to stop most and/or any  anti-depression meds cold turkey can be and/or is life-threatening

"Been on it for two months, at first felt lots of side effects, but get less as time goes by.  Has definately worked.  Find myself happy alot more than before.  Give it time. more outgoing towards coworkers and not so quick to snap at family.",4
"I went from Lexapro to Citalopram because of the price difference.  I feel to some degree this medicine isn't as effective, but I can't be sure because of the nature of the depression and grieving..being a previous care giver, and death of my mate.",3
"I AM DISABLED, AND I GET THE WINTER BLUES. IF IT GOES TILL END OF SPRING,START OF SUMMER I TOLD DOC AND GOT THIS. STARTED AT 10MG TWO WINTERS AGO NOW UP TWO 40MG. HELPS A TON.",5
"I've been on Citalopram for 2 weeks and I've been feeling great at work!! I'm able to get out of bed in the morning and start my day normally, I don't argue with anyone at work and I don't feel like chopping off someone's head!! This medicine has worked great so far. The only side affects I've notice are increased daily headaches, but my daily migraines have gotten a little better, just more frequent.",5
Since I have been taking this drug I find it hard to cry or show mostly any emotion. I am also gaining weight and I don't like that.,3
"I just started this medication on July/17/2009. So, I'm not exactly sure if it is working for me just yet / helping me with my ""Manic Depression"" that I have been diagnosed with, is helping / working for me just yet. My doctor said, and so did the pharmacist, that it may take,  ""UP TO""  one month for the medication to start working properly before I will see any difference with my ""Manic Depression"".",2

"Started on 10mg-did nothing, now on 20 for about 4 days. I feel about the same. If it doesn't do more for me in a month, my doc is putting me on something else. I hope it starts helping because the side effects have been slight.",3

My first medicine for depression and I m a new woman. I felt after two weeks that a huge weight had lifted from my shoulders and I began to unwind like a coiled spring. I don't have any side effects . My life is beginning again.,5
"I am just starting this med and my Dr. said I could have a beer or glass of wine with this but to take precautions and not overdo. However, the med bottle says ""do not drink alcohol with this med"". I'm not a big drinker but we are going on a family vacation next week (18 of us) and of course there will be some drinking. Three of the nephews are bartenders and so they always like to treat their elders to new drinks etc. Will I be OK with 1 or 2 drinks every day? What kind of limits should I take?",3
"I started out on 10mg a day for the first week then up to 20mg the second week. The first three days I had a headache, dry mouth, and my jaw was clenching. It was tolerable. I now feel WONDERFUL! Better than I have in YEARS! I was a complete skeptic plus after reading some of the reviews I was a bit nervous to even start on meds. Well, I'm more energetic. I feel way better about myself no longer just wanting to be alone and cry. No longer feeling like a nervous wreck or having really bad anger. My sex drive has INCREASED! I do have a loss of appetite not too badly though. I still do have a bit of anxiety but citalopram has worked wonders on my depression. I'm still seeing a counselor so I'm sure in time with that it will go work out as well.",5
I'm taking this medication for PMS depression. It alleviated any depression that I was experiencing during PMS. ,5
"This pill is NOT working for me and if you change from one anti-depressant to another, be careful!",1
I started citalopram (celexa) in April and just went off to Zoloft b/c I'm prego.  Does anyone have ringing or humming in the ears w/ this?  I increased to 40mg in May and noticed ringing in ears constantly and headaches with a pulse in my head.  It was awful.  I switched over today and hope it helps.  Cital. helped the depression but for my sister it lessened her appetite and increased mine.  I ate all the time.,4
"I have been prescribed various drugs for my depression symptoms all of which worked to some degree. However, none were effective toward eliminating all of my depression symptoms.  

I have been on citalopram for two months now and have never felt better.  I am more energetic and that foggy, muddled feeling has gone.  My thoughts are now clear and I can focus on problems and plans without all the effort it used to take.  

I don't know whether or not this drug will have the same effect on you as it does me, but if you are having depression symptoms I have two pieces of advice for you:  1) don't stop trying different medications until you have found the one or ones that works best for you; 2) try citalopram.  ",5
could this drug cause blisters. My 81 yr old father was on this drug for a short period until blisters started to appear on the stump of his amputated leg. He has been off of it for 5 days and blisters keep appearing,1
"I have been taking this for two years...At first it appeared to be working...After a period of time I felt depressed and have severe loss of sex drive.After reveiwing the side affects I have identified at least eight ""severe"".

prescribed for depression after back surgery.i feel it was a godsend because the crying jags have stopped and life doesn't seem so horrible anymore!,4
"I have used this for a few years.  I don't feel as stressed out, and I can focus more.  No sexual side effects.  Tried to get off it a couple of times and experienced extreme side effects.  When you take a pill you feel better within a couple hours. That's my only concern.",5
I STILL FIND MYSELF IN A DOWN MOOD MOST OF THE TIME.,3
,4
"Works great.  Dizzy spells, blurry vision and tiredness happened during the first 2 weeks but after getting through those 2 weeks everything is great.  It helps me with my depression and keeps me calm during stressful situations.  Normally when I would be stressing out this drug keeps me calm, cool and collected.  The only side effect I have now is a decreased sex drive.  ",5
"The citalopram worked perfectly for me. You didn't have any ""lingering"" effects during the day to cause you to feel drugged or detached. The only side effect for me was a sexual side effect. Very frustrating! Would recommend use (even with side effect) for treatment of depression/anxiety.",5
,4
"I have been taking 20mg once a day (in the morning) for one week now. I've noticed that I am much more tired during the day, BUT I still keep trucking and get things done (before I would have given in and taken a nap).  I do have a few dizzy spells during the day also.  And I'm experiencing sexual side effects, but it seems to be the opposite of what everyone else is experiencing. I have an INCREASED sexual drive.  I am seriously waiting to be driving down the street and hit a bump in the road and go off.  And I feel this way all day long.  It's really kind of odd. I've also noticed a bit of dry mouth and I tend to daydream more often.  Overall I like how I'm feeling and I'm willing to put up with the few side effects I'm experiencing. =)",4

"I have taken this medication for approximately 2 years.  The first few weeks were challenging as I was thirsty and VERY tired.  This went away after approximately 2 weeks and I felt a greater sense of calm and more like myself.  I am currently tapering my dose as I would like to become pregnant again but am experiencing a kind of dizziness or ""trails"" to my vision.  I am waiting for this to end -hopefully soon!",5
"I started this drug because of my depression, anxiety and night terrors. This drug took effect pretty quickly. I now sleep through the night. The only complaint is that this drug makes me thirsty. I am never without my nalgene now because I feel thirsty all of the time.  The thirst is a small price to pay for my mental sanity though. Overall the experience has been a good one. Family and friends have really noticed a difference in my life. ",4
If you miss a dose you definitly experience withdrawls.,4
I have felt tons better taking this drug,5

I took one 10 mg pill at bedtime and could not sleep all night. in the morning I was sleepy and went back to bed after breakfast. When I got up I was dizze and felt like I was sleepwalking. Checked with the NP at our grocery store and she advised I call my doctor regarding these events before taking another dose.,1
I had been on effexor for years and it no longer worked for me.  This medication saved my life and my sanity.,5
my overall experience has been wonderful. the only side effect that i have noticed is dry mouth.,5
I had  moderate depression and in three days I experienced lifting of the depression. I take 20 mg and have had not side effects,5

"I STARTED TAKING CITALAPROM ABOUT A WEEK AGO. FIRST TWO DAYS, I FELT LIKE A ZOMBIE & ALSO VERY TIRED. I WAS ALSO REALLY DIZZY. I AM ON 20 MG. I WAS TAKING HALF, NOW I AM TAKING A WHOLE PILL. MY BODY IS USE TO THE MED. I HAVE NOT BEEN DEPRESSED AS I WAS BEFORE. SO FAR SO GOOD. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TAKE A WHOLE PILL AT FIRST.",4
I've been taking it for a month. Dr started me out on 1/2 tablet before bed for a week.  I feel like a zombie or number all day and yawn all day so I've not gone to a whole tablet yet.  Have trouble focusing. Don't feel as stressed out though,4
"Give the meds time to work and trust your psychiatrist! It took a few weeks and adjusting the meds (I'm on 30 mg), but I am completely back to normal. I was scared to death to try this med, but now I am perfectly fine.  I can sleep, eat, and be happy again!! DO NOT listen to the comments from patients who have been on citalopram under two weeks. It is medically proven to TAKE TIME. It doesn't work in one to two days!",5
"First day taking citalopram. Really helped to calm my anxiety. Slight spaced out feeling and minor difficulty with focusing. Aside from those, no real side effects. So far so good. Will update soon.",5
"first week, i tried to hurt myself",1
I've been dealing with anxiety for several years. My doctor put me on a 20mg daily dose about two weeks ago after I mentioned the positive results a common patients and friend was having with this drug. Too early to really comment. I do notice I seem to have less energy. I'm willing to continue to give the Rx some time to prove itself.,4
"Taking for PMS.. Very happy with the effectivensee, However I have gain about 15- 20lbs... Not from eating! I work out every day.. Not sure if I should go off or not... I don't want to feel moody but I also don't want to be FAT!!!",5
"Been on this drug for over a year now.  I definitely  feel better than before, however I also changed a lot of things in my life sense.  So, I don't know if it's the medicine or the positive life changes.  I take 20 mg before bed and sleep like a rock but  I feel hungover in the morning & if i get out of bed to quickly I get a major headache... I get a 3-4 day headache at least 1 a month.  Also, very LOW sex drive  I don't mind it but my husband does.  I think it has helped me but I may ask to lower my dosage and eventually stop.",3
"Been taking this medicne after a heart attack last June. I'm very tired, low energy, and have had some weight gain, not due to my eating habits. It may have helped with anxiety in the beginning,but now I'm going to taper off. It sounds like its pretty additive, and I don't need anymore negatives in my life.",2

"IT HAS HELPED AND AT TIMES I FEEL BETTER, THEN IT SLIPS BACK.",3
"I was on Celexa (before generics) for several years during a bad marriage. I don't think I would've survived had a compassionate Dr not suggested I start taking an A-D and doing some other things to manage the stress and depression.

I lost my health insurance not long after the marriage ended (unrelated, long story) and tapered myself off (the non-generic Celexa was very expensive.)

Big mistake. Half a decade later and after a number of setbacks and involuntary life changes and financial problems, I was a mess but because things had been happening slowly, I really didn't see it.

Recently and after a case of the shingles, several rounds of cold and flu, and an inner ear infection that took away my equilibrium...

Some family members sat me down and told me they were very concerned that stress and depression were ruining my health and for what might happen to me...

I went to my Dr and got a prescription for the new generic form.

What a difference! Less than a week back onto a 20mg dose and already things are changing for the better!

A-D's are serious drugs and can have serious side effects, if a prescription does not help or generates overtly negative effects, run back to your Dr and change something. I have a family member who had to go through 4 different drugs before the 5th one did the trick",4

Severe sexual problems includes severe decreased interest in sexual intercourse and in achieving climax.,3
It took about 4 weeks but what a difference i would not have believed it if i did not try it.,5
It works a little but not all the way i still have systems,3
,4
This medicine has helped me to get my life back. I had severe depression and mood swings before taking this. I was unable to consentrate and remember simple things. There has been a major difference in my thinking since I have started taking Citalopram. I feel like a better person.,5
I experience dizziness. I tend not to feel sadness when face with my friends negative experience.I do not feel their pain.,3
it has really helped me and made my life much easier.,4
I have noticed that my overall attitude has changed not to mention my anxiety is managed.  At times I do feel like my brain is working faster than I can but overall I am extremely happy.,5
"Dizziness was my biggest side effect when I began taking this but over time that went away.  I have noticed that I am also constantly tired and have gained 15 lbs.(my eating is at least the same if not improved because of fear of gaining more weight).  I don't really feel like this is helping my depression but I do think it is helping my OCD.  My husband is the one that noticed that.  I have a doctors appt in 2 weeks and I am telling her that I am ready to be done with this med, hopefully it won't be too hard to come off of it.",2
"I used to take Welbutrin and still had anexiety attacks and anger issues, I was taking 3 pills a day. Now I take 1 pill a day and and I dont have any more anexiety attacks and I am really calm and pleasant to be around.",5
I have only been on this med for two days.  Not really seen an effect yet.  I do have a question asto when everyone takes this med.  My Dr said to take it in the AM but I notice that I am very tired at work.,3

I've taken this Citalopram for the past few years and have had great sucess. The depression is gone and I sleep well at night.,5
has anyone suffered from lethargy and drowsiness while taking this drug?,3
"Zapped my energy level to zero. However, has not helped with my insomnia. Did help some in the beginning with my emotional outbursts but after 2months quit working.My mind was always racing. Would still have highs and lows. During that time I also gained 10 pounds due to the medication (my eating habits have not changed). I have already put a call in to get a med change.",2

no sex drive and not interested,4
"I started at 10 mg for a week, increased to 20 mg. Got a little better, but not back to normal. Two weeks ago, my psychiatrist upped my doasage to 30 mg and I feel like myself again! It was an uphill battle and took adjusting the medicine and about 6 very long weeks, but it was worth it. Trust your psychiatrist!!! If I had just listened to myself I would have stopped taking it and never felt better. Listen to them and give the medicine TIME to work! Side effects I have noticed are: slight fatigue, increased sweatiness on palms, feet, & underarms, memory loss. But I can laugh again, sing, sleep, and handle life much more effectively! Give it time! You will make it!",5
"THis is an Update to an earlier post: 
I posted about 2-3 weeks ago. 
The drug has helped me out a lot. I have been able to read and understand the self help and self improvement books. The side effects are minimal from what I experienced in the beginning. I am tired and I do have more head aches, but they are not bad ones. I have keept to 10mg and have not increased my dose to the full amount of 20. Though I do notice that I get a bit shakey and my eyesight seems a little fuzzy at times. I have started to feel down or cry, but now I am able to think why I am feeling the way I do. I am able to turn my mood around before it gets worse. When I do find my mood is getting worse, I can now reason with myself and look at the brighter side of every situation. It has helped me be more understanding, helped me stop yelling and helped me be more calm. I don't experience the Road Rage and am able to be more in control. Once I feel that my situation is changing or better than it was before. I will consult my doctor on how to get myself off of this, as I don't want it to become  a perminanat crutch for my mental health.
I do have a lower sex drive, but it hasn't gone away.    ",5
"I have used citalopram for Parkinsons depression. The Dr has tried to get me off of it but when I quit taking it I get terrible headaches, faintness, nausea and disorentation. When I start taking again I feel better almost instantly. Anyone else have this happen. It is very concerning.",3
"painfull and heavy periods, forgetfullness, confusion, tender breasts, migraines, severe tiredness all the time, depression increasing so don't think they're working.",1
This drug has worked fairly well in treating some short term event related depression. The downside seems to be that I have difficulty sleeping and am tired much more often.,4
been on it for about 6months now and it has helped me out alot. i am not like i use to be in the past with anger and depression issues. ,3
AFFECTED MY SEXUAL DRIVE IN THE WORST WAY,1
"When i first started taking it,my head felt like a bowling ball, absolutley, terrible. been on it now for probably 2 years and now i feel terrible when i dont take the stuff.They do actually, make me feel like myself.",3
"OK so this is my first time on anything, and I was a bit aprehensive about taking a drug to help me and my ""situation"". Ok Depression. My doctor put me on Citalopram at 20mg and asked that I start at 10mg first. I took my first 1/2 pill last night and about 2 hours later, felt like my old self again. I felt ""normal""??? Like I haven't felt in a year or two.  I have already noticed that I am more focused and a lot more level in my mood. I'm not sure if I will stay with the 10mg dose or reduce it to 1/4 of a tablet. Or just keep at the 10mg. I was told that it miht take as much as a month to feel the effects but I noticed them right away. I can actually function and think about things. 

I noticed the following.
no crying.
no rage
no loss of hope. I actually have more hope now. 
I was laughing this morning.
I slept well last night. 

Hope this post helps you. ",5
"I am a typical working ""supermom"" that just felt miserable...tired of the ""day to day"" and feeling increasingly unhappy.  Within a week of taking these meds I was back to myself.  Much more at ease and able to ""deal"" with the pressures/expectations/duties of everyday life.  I'm pretty sure my husband and 2 kids agree - it's just what I needed to take the edge off.  
The only downer - when I DO drink, I get tired VERY quickly.  I can usually skip a dose if I want to party! ",4
"My mood is much better at 20-30 mg.  Still a lot of social anxiety (maybe a small improvement, but not dramatic).  40 mg gave me crazy nightmares, but no side effects at the lower doses.",4
my depression has gotten worse so i am reevaluating these meds. i am not relating it to the pill itself. but to my immediate stress. i do not think this pill is strong enough.  or maybe the mg. need to be upped.,3
"Upon first taking this drug, it made me feel quite nauseaus (SP?). Also, i have experienced vivid dreams which can best be described as bad drug ""trips"". I am however, less depressed/moody. Another side effect i am beginning to notice is a plummet in sex-drive as well as ability to climax. i am taking 20 MG daily and have been taking it for a month...hopefully these side effects will not persist.",3
"I was prescribed this medication, for the second time, for depression. The first doctor to prescribe it didn't listen when I told him it wasn't working. My new doctor prescribed me Lexapro which worked wonders but my insurance would not cover it so he gave me Citalopram. He had to increase it from 20 to 40 because it was not working. I have unfortunately gained 30-40 lbs which isn't helping with the whole depression thing. If I miss a dose, my mood swings are worse and I end up crying because I yelled at my little girl. :(",4
"Been on citalopram for 11 years. It probably saved my life but at a price - spent 11 years tired with low sex drive and very difficult to climax. Have tried to come off them many times and its impossible, feel like ive got a life sentence.",4

I've never had one of those before and though I was having a heart attack.  My heart felt like it was doing flip flops in my chest.  It was very scary.  Within hours of taking a tablet after being out for 3 weeks, I felt my body start to feel normal.  I definately will not let myself run out again, and dread the day I may have to be weaned off of it.",4

"Dealing with grief over the loss of our son. Lost sense of security and well being. Extreme sadness and irritability. Constant anxiety over what the future holds. I have been taking a 20mg dose for approx 6 months. Beginning side effects where nausea, teeth grinding, vivid dreams (good & bad) and just a hollow feeling. Nothing mattered. These all subsided within 3 months. Lingering side effects are sleepiness, weight gain and sex drive. I have tried morning and night,I now take my dose at dinner time and that has helped with some of the sleepiness. My sex drive is low but the actual act has actually been enhanced. The anxiety, grief and irritability are at a much more manageable level. I don't know where I would be without this medication. With it I am a much easier person to live with.",5
I have not had any adverse affects taking this medication.  It has helped me alot.,5

Started at 20 mg, then 30, last 40.  Tapered off right after Christmas 2008 and have some withdrawal symptoms but getting better each day.  Wanted to get off of this to see if I could cope (I hate taking drugs) and will see if natural supplements will work as well if I need them.  Sex drive seems to be coming back which my husband will be pleased with!  Also sleeping better now than when on this drug.",4
can this cause coughing jegs off and on during. and while sleeping?,4
I have insomnia. My scalp is severely itching until I want to dig it. I have a tingling in my neck. My mind does not shut down. I feel that my doctor did not advice me concerning this drug.

It works great for depression and suicidal thoughts. The downside is that I never want sex...I'm 30 with no kids...and I'm always tired and CAN NOT sleep. I'm up every hour or two. I have serious dry mouth too. I really think the lack of sleep (prescription sleep aids/pills aren't helping) is the thing that is the worst.,4

I have gained weight though but am more than happy to accept that for all of the benefits of my new life.  ",5
I have been on citalopram for about 1 month now and I have also had night sweats and vivid dreams in the first 2 wks of treatment.  They are gone now but depression is much worse now than in first wks of treatment.  ,3
"Only took this drug for a week so really didn't expect to see any improvement.  The only side effect I had was significant and resulted in my discontinueing the drug.  I'm embarassed to say that sexually, it prevented me from ""completing the transaction"" - if you get my drift!  Real deal breaker in my book!",1
It helped me balance out the chemicals in my head and let me take things in every day life easier.,4
I was put on citalopram 8 months ago it has done wonders for me.Before treatment I was so depressed I had crazy thoughts just start crying for no reason.Now it don't happen as often       I hope this helps someone.See ya'll later,4

"I went from 20mg one year ago, to 30mg about 4 months later, and I've been on 40mg for 1 week.  Although it's worked, and I've had very few symptoms...some fatigue, some night sweats (which I hadn't realized were symptoms until now).  I'll by seeing a psychiatrist soon, and am curious to see if he/she will leave me on citalopram (which my doctor always refers to as celexa...confusing!).",4
"I suffer from depression, with intermittent anxiety episodes. I had been on Lexapro for almost 3 years, but I got kicked off my parent's insurance and I couldn't afford it, so I requested generics. I've noticed the same mild side effects I had before: mild tremors, yawning, as well as new ones: difficulty concentrating and vivid dreams (and I take it in the morning). As the weeks pass, I know these will subside. Overall, I'm very happy with Citalopram. It works just as well at helping me through each day, I sleep better and I have an appetite again.",4
"my DR., gave me this drug and he should not have given it to me cause i have liver-disease and siezure-disorder. and as a resolte i ended up in the hospital with a high dilantin-level, low blood-pressure,and low-heart rate. i almost died which i plan on sueing him.",1
"I have beenhaving excessive sweating and urination from taking this medication, As soon as I saw the side effects I told my Doctor to take me off it.  Also muscle and joint pain is something I don'y need with Fibromyalgia.",2
Dealing with grief - months of non-stop crying and intense sadness.  Within 3 weeks I stopped crting and have been able to deal with my grief in a healthy way,5
"this medicine made me hullucinate, have chest pain, be nausieated, all kinds of things. ",1
I started off on Zoloft after my mom died and I delivered a still born.  After a month I switched to 20mg of citalopram and was on that for about 10 months.  Now I'm on a 10 mg dosage and almost completely off of it.  It's made my life soo much better.,5

"I have been suffering from major depression for quite sometime and have always had an aversion to taking medication for it. I would have terrible anger occur suddenly and out of the blue, I was sad all the time, I would cut myself and consistently had negative thoughts about myself. After taking this drug for about two weeks all of my prior symptoms are gone, I feel happy and incredible. I have my desire back to do things that I have not wanted to do for some time. I am very grateful for this drug. The only side effects I have experienced are a bit of tiredness and only small warm flashes. I can totally deal with those side effects over the way I was.",5
"ended me up in the hospital, cause it affected my siezures, heart-rate, and liver",1
"my DR., gave me this medicine knowing that I have siezures, liver dease, and I ended up in the hospital and almost died, my dialantin level went real high, my blood pressure&heart rate dropped real low and I am fixin to contact a lawyer to sue them for that.",3
,5
"Would definitely help when i would remember to take it but will suffer intensely sore head & neck aches when i would stop taking them & become stressed.
My headaches seemed to somewhat disappear when i resume taking the cetelapram.",4
My son was taking Effexor XR 150mg but got into the donut hole for my coverage and cannot afford to pay $135.00 a month so my dr. switched me to Citalopram 10 mg- was not working-is that the correct amount that I should be taking?,2
,3
,5
can this be taken at bed time and still get to sleep?I take it in the day time but would rather take it at night. ,3
"I was put on this medication almost 2 months ago for depression. A 20mg dose per day. The first 2 weeks I was foggy and tired all the time, but that went away.  The next 2-3 weeks were heaven.  I could concentrate, there wasn't a black cloud feeling, I was able to sit and enjoy reading again.  I haven't felt that good in ages.
The following couple of weeks things started to get muddled again.  So I am moving up to 40mg per day as per my doctor.
The other side affects I have had have been stomach aches and sweating especially at night.  But nothing I haven't been able to deal with so far.
I wish I would have been prescribed this medication a long time ago. ",4
3 weeks and still feel foggy.does it take longer to work?,2
"Had been on Lexapro for a year (at $120/3 months)  Was given Citalopram when I was in the hospital and told the hospital considered them interchangable.  When I got out I asked my own doc about it.  He explained some little nuances between them but said we could try switching.  I've been on citalopram now for seven weeks.  I see no difference between it and Lexapro, except citalopram saves me $110/ 3 months!!",5
"I did not realise how difficult I was to live with until I started with tis medication. I went to the Dr about what I thought where hormonal issues but after blood tests telling all was normal, I was asked if I was depressed.  After breaking down and crying over how awful my life was, I had to agree I could be.  The first few days I did experience a fogginess where it was hard to get words out when people where speaking to me, but now that I have been taking it for a month, I am not so agressive, do not feel so low, my confidence has come back and I can actually go to dinner parties and not feel so exhausted afterwards by having to speak to people.  I do not feel overly tired but I do take it right before I go to bed.",5
well i am not thinking about things i did not want to think of.,3
"I have taken Citalopram for several years now.  At first it was very hard for my body to get used to but has steadied my emotions, although I am much more tired.  I also have experienced very vivid dreams which was a listed side effect but I didn't see anyone else list.  Has anyone else experienced a change in their dreams?",4
"I have had very good luck with this but just today, found out that my doctor is concerned that this may be causing me to have a slow heart rate.  This does concern me a lot.",5
"I was taking cymbalta, but it got very expensive. I've been taking this for only week and a half and I've noticed how tired I feel and a slight nausea and headache. Not sure if I'm going to contine.",3
I have been taking this anti depressant for 3months now and am only now starting to feel the benefit. I started on 20mg and GP increased my dose to 40mg daily. I am feeling better than I have felt for sometime even thou it did take about 8weeks to start to feel the effects. I think anyone who is taking them and or about to take them remember they do take a while to work before you can notice the diffrence. ,4
I have been on this medication for nearly a month and I feel no different then I did..I am now taking 20 mg at bed time...And all the symptoms I had originally are still there...I'm moddy ...filled wit rage or sad/depressed/over whelmed all the time...The only thing I am geting from this is Tired all the time...So far I wouldn't recommend it.,2
 balanced mood ,5
"Also wanted to add to my previous post that it took several weeks for me to feel the full effects of this drug. Hang with it for awhile. Everything gets a little better with every day you take it. MOST of the side effects diminished greatly for me after a couple weeks. Seemed like I had 'em all. Nausea, dizziness, forgetfulness, blurred vision, drowsiness, felt spacey, hard time concentrating. Most are pretty much gone, tiredness seems to be the worst but still better than when first started.
 Also for the guys, Dr. said it could cause impotence which it did but only for about a week and went away. Now, it's just a little harder to have an orgasm, but thats ok. Hope this helps you out.",5
"I've been on this med for 3 months now. Side effects first couple weeks were horrible but stuck with it. Still suffer tiredness so went off for a few days. Quickly went back to my anxiety, depressed moody old ways by the fourth day (had lots of energy though). Quickly went back on. I take 20mg. per day and have to say I like it but not the tiredness. My mood is superior to what it was so I won't be going off for now. I now sing to myself all day, I haven't done that for years. I feel good and happy.",5
I have only been on the drug for two days but i already feel a difference. I do yawn a lot more and i have always had headaches and trouble sleeping. Its like a fog has been lifted and see everything clearer or even prettier. I hope it will continue to work. Only time will tell.,4
,5
"This is my first week on Citalopram. I'm living in a fog and cant focus on what I'm doing or what I'm saying to people. My depression has made me really self conscious, and it can be really hard talking to people while trying to be myself. Hope this makes everything clear again and i can get out of my head.",4
this is the first medication i have tried. my doctor said it would help with depression and anxiety. i have been on it for just over a month and have noticed a big change in my mood and attitude. my family loves the effect it has had on me. i do yawn alot and have more dreams then usual but it beats the way i felt before. i no longer feel like i am living in a fog.,4
I have been on this medication for 1 week and I was ok the first couple of days but now I'm having a hard time sleeping! Should I be taking at night instead of morning? And I've also been getting headaches more often!  Has anyone had these symtons? Hopefully it will get better!,4
I have been taking this pill for several years. I was first started on just 10mg and I am now up to 20mg daily. I didn't really notice any difference at first until my family and friends noticed when I didn't take it. Then I got to thinking and watching and it did help me alot and now I can tell a difference I am back to my old self. I won't ever forget to take it again.,5
I have been on the medication for 5 days and no problems! I take in the morning at 10am that way I can sleep at night.  So far I'm satisfied with the drug.,4
,3
,4
This is my first day on this medicine. I was put on it because of a bad childhood and its effecting me now and also because of the death of a friend. The dr says i should take 10 mg for 6 days and 20 mg thereafter. I just took my first 10 mg and I feel very awake. Its 10:30 pm and I don't think I'll be going to bed for a few more hours. I just hope it clears my mind and helps me get over at least some of this depression.,4
This is my second day on Citalopram so far no problem. The first day I noticed that I was very sleepy in the morning 2 hrs after but I was good the rest of the day.  ,5
quit working after time & i was at the max dose,4
Today in my first day taking citalopram. Like many of you my insurance with Lexapro was too expensive and this medication was giving. I will keep you posted on my progress with this new medication.,3
"I've been on this medication for a week & it has helped me a lot. I no longer just lay in bed. I actually want to do things now. It is a lifesaver! Only real side effect for me was the increased sweating, but that compared to being depressed is way worth it.",4
I was going thur a really rought deforce with kids. I spoke with me Doctor. He placed me on this Med and it worked great with me. I bless GOD and my children and think my Doctor everyday. ,4
"I developed some nausea in the first 4 to 5 weeks of taking it.
It helped me get over the painful part of depression so taht I could concentrate on using strategies to help me improve my mood.",4
I found my issue becoming worse so I stop taking it and still looking for the drug to help with depression. Everyday life is very hard for me and I hope I can find that right one.,2
It has helped me establish self-confidence and the ability to socialize more with strangers.,4
"My husband passed away after 37 yrs of marriage. About 8 mos after he died I became more depressed than the normal depression one goes through after going through this type of loss.  I wasn't sleeping and I cried all the time.  I even had a suicidal thought.  It was more of an analagy, but it scared me. The doctor was more concerned about my not sleeping and my depression since I had no intention of committing suicide.  He put me on Citalpram and it has worked wonders.  I sleep at night, and can handle my life better. ",5
I HAVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WHICH CAUSES ME TO HAVE TERRIBLE BOUTS OF DEPRESSION. THIS DRUG FOR ME HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER WITH NO SIDE AFFECTS.,5
I just had a baby. I have post partum depression. I love this medication. The only thing is that it makes me very sick and sometimes dizzey. But my realtionship with my kids and my husband has been alot better.,5
"I wonder if I need to dramatically increase the doseage. I will to to my Doctor. It has only been so-so in helping me. I have no side effects from the drug. But, I often plan out killing myself. But, that has nothing to do with the drug.I have done that before medication. I take a drug to sleep, and one for anxiety, too. The drugs only work moderately well. But, no side effects.I find sitting in the corner of a dark room helps me, too.",3
"This drug is fantastic! Ive been on it for three months, at 20mg i had very few side effects . I feel so much better.  Citalopram gets a lot of bad press but i urge anyone to give it a try. it takes a while to see any benefit over 4 weeks for me so please be patient.",5
I have had strong feelings of nausea which has hindered my desire to get on with normal activities & although I do get hungry I am not enjoying my food. I was on 20mg/day and it has been reduced to 10mg to see if this nausea subsides. ,3
,3
,4
I think that it has helped but I seem to be gaining weight is this a side effect? I am being treated for depression after a serious car accident.,4
"I've been on this drug(20mg) for 6months + and I don't like it. It has made all my symptoms worse. I either can't sleep or sleep too much, my weight is like a yo-yo, my moods are all over the placer and so is my mind; my thoughts are incredibly scattered and disorganised, and my paranoia has not shifted. Unfortunetely I was allergic to Fluxotine.",2
After trying several medication over the past year I was put on citalopram. So far so good. I started on 20 MG with very few side effects. Just been put on 40mg and wait to see how I tolerate it. The only side effect so far is prolong ejaculations which is great for me and my partner. ,4
"I find myself clenching my jaw, especially while sleeping, when I can sleep.  I have a hard time sleeping",2
"I am on 40mg and have trouble falling asleep,concentrating and memory sees different, have a hard time staying on task. Panic attacks are gone, but I can cry at the drop of a hat.  I wonder if I should drop my dosage to 20mg for a couple of weeks to see if that makes any difference.",3
"in the beginning only dizziness and metalic taste, now it has been about seven months and my memory doesn't seem to be doing to well, my attention span is so small now. I don't seem to have the ability fully express what I feel because I have no clue. My mind is constantly scatterd. I either sleep too long or don't sleep...mostly don't sleep...my ability to make decisions has gone down, my ocd has gotten worse in the matter of ever aspect in my life. I seem to not remember a lot of conversation, things I watch and so forth.",3
"I have been on Citalopram 20mg in the morning for 11days. I have notice that I've not been anger as much. but Im starting to get a list of more anxity attacts with increaced heart rate, which I have never had before. lost of intrest of eating at all. I started to have dreams and night sweats. I have never had dreams before so it is making me confused. lost of lebito, which is not good for my marriage at all. I plan on give it another week then try to get something else a try. ",2
"I have been on this for a week and am severly sick to my stomach with cramps, not sleeping at night, loss of appetite and sexual drive and severe headaches.  WIll this go away or should i contact my doctor? ",3
,4
"I was severely depressed thinking of suicide about every day (due to health problems from a MVA), not wanting to get addicted to any drugs, but I had to do something so I've been on this drug for 3months now and have not had many thoughts of suicide and have a very different frame of mind. I know my family is much happier and so am I! I do have really wierd dreams and they seem so real and like another mans comment I had to stop for the first time during sex because I couldn't go any longer(can't climax but had best time ever), My wife thought I was on viagra, thats funny, I mean great! ",4
Ive only been taking it for two weeks so i dont quite feel any results but i dont have any side effects at all!,4
"This was the first medication I was put on.  It helped my depression and anxiety immensely yet their were two side effects I experienced while taking citalopram.  I was tired all of the time and at night had trouble falling asleep.  Then there were the sexual side effects which were more frustrating considering i'm relatively young.  Overall the bad outweighed the good so I was taken off it, with no luck so far on other drugs (prozac).    ",3
"This medication has been very helpful for me.  I am very happy and content with my life at times.  Your life is what you make of it.  I have been on this medication for about 2-3 years.  I have been on different doses and I have finally found the dosage that works. (20 mg @ night).  My life is not perfect and no ones is, but this medication really helps.",5
This keeps me from so sad about my life in general.,4
,4
"I have taken this for 2 years and feel like it has helped greatly.  My doctor said that it would also help with the ""change of life"" issues and it sure has.  No more night sweats.  It was interesting to read others reviews about the dreaming.  I didn't realized that it could be the reason I have been having very vivid dreams every night.  Sometimes those dreams stick in my head all day and I have to think really hard if it was something that really happened or something I dreamed.   Overall though I am very please with the results.",5
"I have only been taking this medication for the past two days, and prior to this I was taking xanax. Doc told me it would take about three weeks to get into my system but I have been feeling a difference just in two days. Hope it gets better from all the good reviews I have read about this medication. I didn't take the xanax other then when I ONLY felt like I needed one. They were very addicting when I was taking them as prescribed. I was happy to hear that citalopram isn't addicting.  I use to get upset easily and cry when things really got to me, now I have been more relaxed and feel better overall. Im not on edge about things the last couple days and I hope I have the same luck as the other users at dropping a few pounds! Side effects with me has been a little dry mouth and maybe a little tired, but so far so good! Will report later with further comments.",4

I have been taking this medication for 6 months now and it has been a life saver! I was suffering from depression and anxiety. Within two weeks it felt like a light had been turned on. I could get up and take care of my kids. I no longer had these horrible feelings of wanting to do crazy things! Its a MIRACLE drug. I have not had any side affects. ,5
"I have a brother on this medication.  He can sleep for 3 days only getting up for necessities, food, drink, etc. The pattern seems to be 3 days down, 3-4 days up and then down again.  Anyone else have problems staying awake?",3
"It was prescribed to me for severe depression after my divorce.  My wife of 14 years divorced me for a 24 year old kid who worked for us, she was 38.  A friend recommended a psychologist but after the session she said ""you need to see a psychiatrist"".  She recommended one who said ""you're in pretty bad shape, let's see how you do with this drug"".  Well, after less than a week, I was alive again.  I slept well, no dreams, no anxiety attacks, overall happiness (before I felt like wanting to cry all the time) and best of all, sexually I performed like a million.  No ED or premature ejaculation.  I dated a lot of girls in their 20s (I'm 40) and many said they couldn't believe a guy my age could outperform kids their age.  When I told the Doctor I had ED he said the pill could help, but I didn't mention the PE.  It was after a couple of weeks that I noticed how long I was lasting that I looked it up and learned that Citalopram could help eliminate this condition and believe me it did.  This pill truly saved my life.
",5
"This medication works very well for me. I have been on it for almost a year. I have experienced a few side effects though: heat rash when exposed to sunlight for long periods, sleepiness and yawning, strange dreams, and most of all, weight gain. I have gained about 10 pounds since being on it. Oh well, I'd much rather be fat and happy!!!",4
"I have been on this medication for 5 days. I am still getting use to the dull headaches and loss of wanting to eat. As far as depression and anxiety, I don't feel as down or upset as before. I will update in a couple of weeks.",3
,5
"I've been using Citalopram for a couple of weeks for mild depression and stress; side effects are the nausia, sleepiness and yarning and I just experienced a few crazy dreams last night, but I nothing tragic. I feel calm and relaxed but I don't feel like myself.  Well I'll give it more time to see if Citalopram will help me get back on track.",3
"I just starded taking Citalopram 10mg, It's the lowest dose. I have been searching it up and I have read of alot of reviews saying how you get crazy dreams as a side affect? Is that also caused with the lowest dosage? and if so about when does it usually start? Im just concerned about it.",3
I take citalopram 20mg and it has helped me alot with the pain i been having in the back of my neck. wow i was amazed that this one actually works i taken zoloft for a year and it wasnt helping with my pain. i been taking citalopram for two years and i seen a big difference in my mood swings and my anger out bursts. ,5
"I've been on this for about 5 months, it's alright. But it causes me to have horrible dreams, or nightmares. They cause me to lose sleep because of that. But it does work. very well. ",4
"I've been on this for over five years.  It's the only antidepressant that consistently works for me.  Although it has caused ED, I'd rather that than the depression.",5
"Have only been on it for a month, but it seems to be working.  Need more time.",3
"along the 2nd day of treatment, I noticed a change in my thoughts, making myself get up,having a normal conversation, ect..............!!!!!!!",4
I have been on this med for almost 6mos and I feel a whole lot better!!  I was sleepy at first but the last few mos have been great. I don't cry all the time anymore or lay on the couch. I feel really good..,5
"After being on this medication for almost a year, I didn't notice a change, but my husband did.  He said I was less moody and angry all the time. I'm not sure what kind of feeling or feelings I have. I do notice that I don't cry as much as I used to, but more often than not, I feel like there's no emotions.  Like this medication is holding me back from being who I am, good and bad.  After not taking this for almost 2 months, I started to feel very tense, jittery, and angry over the slightest thing. Annoyed at everything. I took two tablets, thinking that that would calm me down, and I had a very scary reaction of rapid heartbeat, excessive shaking and the feeling of loosing consciousness.  I also had fleeting thoughts of hurting myself.  My husband took me to the emergency room as a percaution. I don't want to depend on this medication, but I guess I'll have to.",3
It has only been 10 days since I started this medicine after trying prozac and paxil. Citalopram 20mg has helped alot. I feel great so far. My husband has even noticed a diffence for the good. I also have been taking it night the only thing neg. effect I have noticed is night sweats. I will report back at a later date.,5
"Take at night only. I've been taking it for about 3 months now. This drug works great, took a couple of weeks to start, so give it time. Stopped the crying, wild thoughts and over eating. ",5
"On Celexa, then later generic citalopram, 20 mg,  for over 7 years now. No major depressive episodes or panic attacks (other than a few caused by other drugs) during this time. If I remember correctly, blurred vision the first week, but virtually no side effects since. Probably decreased libido but hasn't adversely affected that area of my life too much. It says not to drink alcohol, but I've never seen any real interaction while drinking. In all, a great choice, having had bad experiences with Zoloft (flat, 'zombie' mood) then Prozac (fine for a while but then truly horrible side effects when restarting it after a few months off). I question whether I still need it sometimes, but for now its still with me.",5
No more mood swings or anxiety BUT I feel tired during the day because of the crazy dreams at night.  Just read it may be better to take at bedtime.  ,3
"This is my 2nd day on Citalopram 20mg. I take it at night. Seems to relieve negative thought patterns. Side effects so far: yawning, dry mouth, jittery in am. I'll check back in a bit.",4
"Best thing I've ever taken. I found myself turning into this scared of everything person that just wanted to sleep all the time and it has turned everything around for me. It has even helped me to not crave food half as much! It allowed me to be more confident at work, with myself, and even in my classes in college! I would recommend it to anyone.",5
I suffer from depression and sever anxiety disorder.  I have taken Citalopram for over a year now and it has saved my life.  I have improved exponentially since before hand.,5
,3
I feel a lot more social again.,5
"I wrote a review earlier but I am updating after 4 months on this drug.  I was being treated for both depression and anger and this has helped immensely with both.  I find myself calm, happy, rolling with the punches, and making rational decisions.  I did have sexual side effects (decreased libido, prolonged ""O"") for a while but they went away and that has returned to normal. This is a person I like being, I hope I can feel this way without the drug. ",5
"I was orignally on the lowest dose, now on 40mg, using it since Jan. 08. I am very jittery, sleepy during the day, wide awake at night, fuzzy mind, NO, NO sex drive.....a complete 360 on that! ",1
"I have been on this drug for 1 week now for depression and panic attacks.  I am finally starting to feel a little normal.  I am less stressed and I don't worry as much. I have lost my appetite which is worrying me, but I could lose a couple pounds.  I have a little blurred vision (problems focusing)  but I think this will work great.  I am taking 10mg.",4
Took 20mg for 3 months. I am taking 40mg for almost 2 years now. At first the side effects were horrible. Then I got a new doctor and she told me to take it in the morning instead of in the evening. I love it now. Everything is perfect. ,5
"My husband has been on Citalopram for 2 years in varying dosages along with other anti-depressants. He got up to 60mg and it seemed to help. No real side effects except he needs to take it in the morning. Doctor is now decreasing dosage to wean him off in preference of a new drug. This change, 2 weeks in, seems to be doing the trick. Still has some bad days but not NEAR as often and no where near as bad.",4
i do have some of the side effects  memory  confusion  in time and place  tremor of the head sometime not allways ; some loss of sleep  getting to sleep then waking shortly after;,4
"I started taking 20mg about 3 months ago. I noticed a difference after a couple of weeks, but after a couple of months I didn't feel I was as happy as I wanted to be. I tried adding Wellbutrin so that I could also quit smoking. The side affects were bad for me and I hadn't cut down on the smoking. I switched to 40mg of Citalopram two weeks ago and it's working amazingly for me. After being depressed for 10 years, I never thought I could actually be this happy. If this drug doesn't work for you, don't give up, there is something that will work for you. It might take a long time to find the right drug and dosage, but it's well worth it in the end. I'm glad I finally got help.",5
"I'M NOT SURE IF IT HELPS ME THE WAY MY DOCTOR HOPED THAT IT WOULD, I STILL HAVE DAYS WHEN I FIND IT HARD TO GET THROUGH THE DAY.",4
"I started taking Celexa about a month ago for severe depression and anxiety. Although it hasn't taken the depression and anxiety totally away (it's not a happy pill) I feel motivated and can actually push the down feelings away and focus on something else. My depression isn't absorbing my life anymore, and I can function like I used to. I only wish that I would feel totally normal with no down thoughts, but I think therapy will help that go away. I have had no side effects except for yawning and tiredness a few hours after I take it, which helps me go to sleep, and this way I don't need a sleep drug for insomnia. I feel a little of the decreased sex drive, but that is a small price to pay for leading a normal life.",5
"I found that my whole life experience worstened and I encountered severe suicidal thoughts. T rying to commet suicide twice! My female partner was a huge cause of going on Citalopram in the first place. I was trying to stabelize my family. It's her way or the highway. Also, I thought it would help me with the mind games she always played! She always has to have her way.",1
this works,5
NO sex drive with this medicine. switched from lexapro to citaprolam due to insurance. I've gained weight and am tired all the time. I hate it.,3
"Of course, taking any new med, it takes time to get used to it; however, I've waited a long time to ""get used"" to it. It makes me dizzy, always sleepy and extremely irritable. I don't feel like myself. It's an off and on feeling. So after 3 months of this drug, I'm going to seek something new.",2
this medication was very disatissfying for me it totally took away the little sex drive i had and did not help at all with my depression i wouldnt recommend this for anyone also kills your appetite guess its good if you are over weight.,1
"Since I have been on this drug, I have changed from being very depressed and have become a lot calmer in myself and to others.",5
I have been taking this medication for 3 months and am happy with the results.,3
This anti-depressant medication has helped me to be more satisfied with my life and motivated.,5
This medication has hepled me a great deal with my moods and helps my mind to relax which helps me sleep 100% better than before.,5
"It has worked when others have not. I have gained about 20 pounds in two years and have just begun sweating more, but it works so I will continue to use it.",4
"I was useing Lexipro till I couldn't afford it anymore. Needed to go to a generic. Went from 10mg to 40mg overnight. Been on it sence the first of the month. Lost my appetite totally (lost 12 pounds), things that used to bother me dosen't bother me much anymore, and I am more at ease to talking to people that I had a problem with before. When I take it at bedtime I have to also take a sleeping pill so I can sleep. Really don't know the sexual side effects are. I am sick with the flu right now so that dosen't help, but it makes getting up in the morning a little easier. I have noticed I am alot quieter, I stay in the background and I have alot more patience for my kids. Great drug but gotta get used to the side effects.",4
"i got on this med because my fluoxetine stoppped working. after 2 weeks of taking this i had a slump, i didn't geet out of bed for 2 days. even now after 4 weeks i still get naseous after i take it,with previous meds the nasea subsided after a week or so. also 2 weeks into taking it i was unable to have an orgasm. my insomnia is worse now then when i was off meds.i am groggy and in a daze most of the time. i can't get my work done at my job.so bacically i can't eat, i can't sleep, sex is useless, i am more frustrated and depressed then when my last meds stopped working. i'm misserable. i told my dr how the meds were(not) working and was told give it 2 more weeks now after that 2 weeks i have to wait a week to get in to see her. blah ",2
It worked well in the 20mg dose but i lost all sexual desire.  then i used the 10 mg dose and it did not work as well.,3
"The first few days were terrible. I couldn't sleep,and spent the second night feeling like I was suffering from the worst hangover of my life! By about the 3rd or 4th day however I have felt like my old self. This is worth persevering with.",4
"I have been on this medication for 4 months and it has been perfect.  I just needed something to take the edge off of life and this worked.  The only side effect is dry mouth about an hour after I take the medicine and it makes me sleepy, so I take it before bed and I wake up refreshed.",5
With in a few weeks of being put on Celexa my fiance and I both noticed a complete change in my attitude. I was diagnosed with depression in May of 2007 and this medication has helped wonders. I love it. I do hope that someday soon I can slowly take myself off of it.,5
"I am approaching 2 weeks on Citaloprm. I get flashed of calmness, but still have minor depression and anxiety. I am also drinking 2-3 glasses of wine per night, is this erasing any benefit I could be getting?",3
"i have suffered from major depression for years and panic attacks. I tried: zoloft, wellbutrin, paxil, and so many others. Most made me gain weight because they made me so lazy. I was started on Celexa one month ago..WOW   what a difference!!! I feel well, my mood is well balanced. No crying spells, no depression!  I feel like a dark cloud has been lifter off!! I have had NO side effects. I am not hungry all the time. I am hoping that to loose these extra pounds now that i feel ""well"". I have energy to want to exercise and not be lazy.
I recomend this 100%
",5
"I am on 40mg and it seems to allow me to level out! I don't have the anxiety attacks as often and they are not as severe. Should I be taking this at night, or in the morning? I have been taking it mornings now.",3
I started taking Citalopram about 3 months ago for depression. It took a couple of weeks for it to take effect but I feel wonderful now and back to my old self. I take it before bed and sleep like a baby and I did not gain any weight-I actually lost about 5 lbs.,5
,5
no help ,1
"I've been on this medication for about 7 years (after other SSRIs) and it has been effective.  My mood has levelled out, with very few highs or lows.  But my weight has gone up, I fall asleep when sitting on a chair and I have short-term memory loss.  One thing that I have learnt is that you need to match the dosage with any weight gain - I had put on quite a bit of weight and a small rise in the dosage did wonders.",3
"Was prescribed this after my insurance would not cover Lexapro, which I preferred.  Was given this for minor depression, irritability, tendency to cry and inability to sleep well.  I've been on it a month.  Pros:  Much less irritable, no crying and fall asleep within a short amount of time at night.  Cons: No appetite (however no weight loss either darn!), night sweats and increased sleepiness. ",4
"My husband had esophagal and tongue cancer. Lots of awful treatment & lots of pain.  After my husband died, I couldn't stop crying at very inappropriate times, making work and social life very difficult.  It didn't help that I was going thru menopause at the same time.  This has been a Godsend.  I had very few side effects and they were gone in a short time.",5
"i've been taking Citalopram for almost a year and i think it's great,it don't make me sleepy like most medication do,i don't cry as much and i have more patiences but i have gained some weight and thats the only downfall i have.",5
"Anti depressants work for some not others. It seems I react to anti depressants no matter which ones. Suicidal, aggressive behaviour etc, check out this link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akathisia .",2
,5
"I was prescribed this drug after returning from a deployment.  I would take it, then stop, i dont recomend this because it made me extreamlly nausious, I would vomit about twice a day.  Now I take it everynight, and have seen a great improvement.  I used to get very depressed when I would get my period, crying and everything, This last time, I didnt even know I was getting my period, I'm a much nicer, calmer person now.  Love it",5
I have been on Citalopram for almost a year. I have noticed weight gain and i have been yawning a lot. On the Plus side I am much happier (well not about the weight) with everything. ,5
"I changed from Lexapro to Citalopram (chemically much the same) due to the lesser expense of the generic. I have also taken Paxil and Prozac, and on this drug, I have the least amount of sexual side effects (no reduced libido). I have side effects of some sleepiness and yawning, but not much else. I have not gained any weight while on this drug. I sleep well. Overall, I am less edgy and not as easily ""upset"" as I was without it.",4
"I have been on this drug for 3 months.It has helped elevate my mood and I find myself laughing more.The side effects seem to be yawning,slight weight gain due to the desire to snack and excesive sweating while sleeping",4
"I was switched to this med, because my weight gain was out of control on Flouoxitine, this is a much better alternative. My overall happiness has greatly improved. I have decided that the yawning, and sometimes tiredness is just part of the depression package, sure beats sadness!!!!",4
"I have been on this for 5 years, I yawn a lot, I sleep great(i always did before), my appetite is the same as it has always been, the best thing in did for me was that I am not so irritable and easily annoyed as I was before. Everyone responds differently to it. ",4
,5
It didnt seem to do anything despite 4 months of taking citalopram. Found fluoxotine much better,3
"Although this drug is the forerunner to Lexapro, the one molecule difference has worked wonders for me.  Lexapro made me too manic which in turn made me more anxious.",5
"I reviewed this drug after 2 days of taking it on 12/7. The 3rd day was fabulous - no headaches or nausea... I was in the best mood of my life. The 4th day was pretty good too, but every day after has been fairly blah. I suppose my disposition has improved a bit, but I'm still dealing with the non-hunger and I have lost 7 pounds because I can only manage to eat an orange or a yogurt every day. My hair has been falling out like it did after I gave birth. It definitely increased suicidal thoughts when dealing with a terrible break up two days before Xmas (though I had the presence of mind to have friends stay with me and not be alone), but it has helped me deal with everything better thus far. I'm going to take it for another month and see how things go. I'll let you know if anything changes.",3
"This seems to work for me I suggest taking it at nightime as it makes me sleepy but it may 
not effect others this way.  I have had not side effects that have made me need to stop taking this medication.s",3
"I was taking Lexapro, but it was very expensive. I switched to the generic citolopram and it is very effective.",5
"Citalopram has been as effective as any antidepressant I've taken.  (and I've taken most of them [SSRI's])  However, the sexual side effects have been difficult to deal with. Erection problems and anorgasmia seem to be more pronounced than with some of the other drugs.  My doctor and I have been trying to work around these problems with the ED drugs (expensive!) and several others to deal with the anorgasmia.  Typical.  Other drugs are needed to counter the side-effects of another!  Has anyone had success dealing with this.  If so, please post your experiences.",4
"This has been a wonder drug for me.

N o problems after a lifetime of dpression and severe anxiety!  My chest pains went completely away immediately after taking this drug.",5
"It only took 4 days when I noticed how beautiful the Christmas Tree was!  I can sit with my husband and watch TV instead of being shut in my bedroom, now that is huge.",5
,4
"It's been good overall. I just get headaches and there is a tendency to yawn loudly that is out of my controll. I preferred Lexapro, because I had less side effects, but my health provider no longer covers it. This is a relatively good substitute. ",5
"don't like the tiredness, weight gain through altered thoughts, short-term memory problems.",5
"Taking this medication made it almost impossible to concentrate at work effectively, or to respond with alertness.  I did sleep better, but the side effects out weigh the benfits for me.  ",3
"my lows are almost gone, but I can't sleep at night at all,I;m real slow in the day and sometimes quick to anger,",3
"When zoloft,or the generic, stopped working for me I had to try alot of different ones to find on that worked.  Citalopram, is very, very effective. No issues at all.  Other drugs caused me to be very ""high strung"", others left me appethetic.  This drug is really effective, back to normal.  What more can you ask for.",5
"I have been on this for 2 days and I can already tell a difference. I have less bad thoughts and anxiety attacks, though this could also be from the ridiculous headache that I have had since I started taking it. I have been sick to my stomach and hardly able to eat also. I slept GREAT the first night, but only managed to get 1 hour of sleep last night - will try taking it in the morning to see if that helps. The other strange thing is that I am a very busy, rapid thinking person and if you picture all the trains of thought you have at once (which is typically 7) as lanes on a highway, I feel like 5 lanes have been blocked off and traffic is trickling through. Does anyone know how long the headache and nausea are supposed to last? I will post again as progress continues and side effects taper off.",4
"Just getting started on it, side effects are lower than with lexapro, but the drug is not as effective for me.  Yawning feels odd, its unexplainable, but weird.  Having trouble sleeping, but my mood is better.  If I had my way, I'd be on Lexapro, but insurance won't cover it anymore.  A good alternative though. ",4
i recently had back surgery and could not go back to my job.workmans comp had denied benefits which put a huge financial strain on my family.i was very depressed and this medication helped me tremendously.i no longer cried every day as before and i also do not have a bleak outlook for the future.,5
"I got on this because I experienced too many side effects with another antidepressant.  On this one, I have relatively few.  I have gained about 5 pounds, but that is okay because I do not weigh very much.  It has helped with my depression, but I still feel anxious a lot, but that is probably mostly a logical reaction to life changes.  The problem is that I get very moody if I forget to take this medication, which I often do.  I then usually remember a few hours later and take it and start feeling fine soon after.  I have even experienced a panic attack because I forgot to take my dose of citalopram one day.  Also, I have been having worse nightmares than normal since getting on this, that bother me more than they used to.  Otherwise, this seems to be a good drug for me with few side effects, and hardly any physical side effects (no sexual problems unlike with Paxil :D )",4
"I'm somewhat confused:? That's one of the side effects I have, not to mention the weight gain. After about a year on the med I'm starting to get the same initial symtoms. With the addition of memory loss, and loss for words.",3
"Effects were immediate for me.  The results are very positive.  My sense of despair has vanished...my emotional mood swings are minimal, and my irritablility dramatically reduced.  My only caution is that I started on too high a dose at first and had some bad side effects.  Once that issue was addressed, I have been extremely pleased.",5
,3
After suffering for 6 years with depression and anxiety issues this has been a god send. Within the first 2 weeks I began to feel like myself again. I take it before bed every night and I sleep 100x better (I have been on and off prescription sleep meds for my insomnia for 2 years) the only side effect that really bugs me is increased sweating. It seems when I am dealing with a situation that used to send me into an anxiety attack I can handle it mentally but not physically. I have experienced a loss in appetite opposite to most of the reviews I read but with all the left over baby weight plus my late night stress/depression bingeing it doesn’t feel that bad. I also finally feel enough like my self to go back to swimming and the gym. So I am sure that I can get my appetite back under control. ,4
"Excellent results, cost-effective.I feel like me again!",4
"The only side effect I get from taking this medication is I find myself yawning quite a bit.  It isn't that I am tired, but it is a common side effect that can be a little annoying at times.  Otherwise the small amount I take (10mg) daily in the morning helps keep my mind balanced without feeling as though I don't have control of my own thoughts and feelings.",5
"This is the first anti-depressant that had no side effects for me and it changed my life.  For years I didn't laugh much and I was unhappy.  About 2 weeks after starting this medicine, I realized that I felt like ""myself"" again.  I recommend Celexa to everyone who can take it! ( I take it at night because it DOES make me sleepy.)",5
"I take 40mg each morning.  I had no nausea and after a week or so at this dose my symptoms improved dramitically.  No more panic, crying or feeling terribly sad.  My sleep pattern improved too.  I used to take ages getting to sleep and wake up in the very early hours.  I had tried several other SSRIs but none of them worked long-term.  Citalopram is different!  I can get on with my life and no side-effects! I am a pharmacist as well as a patient and am so glad to have been prescribed this medecation.",5
"6 weeks of use has improved depression but side affects of insomnia, low energy, lower heart rate & grogginess late into the morning.",4
"Though it did improve my symptoms somewhat, I would not likely recommend this medication to others. I switched to Citalopram from Lexapro, which worked great aside from side effects in the first 2 months. Lexapro was unfortunately not covered by insurance, which was why I switched. I was on Citalopram for nearly a year, but it was not as effective as Lexapro had been. My mood was much more variable - good on some days, but terrible on others. In addition, I gained 20 lbs on this medication because it increased my appetite and caused me to crave carbohydrates. I am currently seeing a Naturopathic Doctor and my treatment consists of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and fish oils. I feel better than I have in 10 years, without any chemical drugs and no side effects whatsoever.",3
"This drug worked well for me for about 3 months and then I became resistant and needed a higher dose. After my dosage increase the side effects began to build up. The problem was, I didn't know that I was experiencing side effects from this drug - I thought I was just becoming very ill. After an MRI and spinal tap other tests to rule out multiple sclerosis (I seriously had 95% of the symptoms of MS) and a week in the hospital, I stopped taking this medication. The side effects completely stopped after about a month and a half and that was when I associated the 2. I wish doctors knew more about the drugs they are prescribing because I went to doctor after doctor with my symptoms and not ONE suggested that I stop or switch medications or even HINTED that the symptoms were associated with the drug. ",4
it accually made me worse.,1
"This medication has changed my life.  It has saved my 8 year long relationship and has given me a new outlook on life.  I now look forward to waking up and working.  I now feel more in love with my family and girlfriend than ever.  I can finally say ""I am happy"" ALL day EVERY day.  My mood used to be a ROLLERCOASTER it was up down up down up down...my mood has now stabilized and is constantly NEUTRAL no ups no downs im just me.  I HIGHLY recomend this medication to anybody feeling depressed, anxiety, less interest in life etc. 

PS: I am also taking 0.5mg's of Xanax

-Shane",5
"Prior to taking this medication I was experiencing severe depression symptoms--crying, loss of appetite, anxiety, sleep problems.  Once the medication was started and a therapeutic level was determined, my mood improved, appetite improved, anxiety symptoms decreased and rarely occur.  This medication has been very effective for me.",5
"Ive been on this drug for 6years and i have now come of it ,but i was fine for two weeks and now i want to cry all the time ,does this mean i have to go back on it and be on this for the rest of my life?",5
,5
Helps me a lot with no side effects. ,5

seems that the deppression does mot go away,2
