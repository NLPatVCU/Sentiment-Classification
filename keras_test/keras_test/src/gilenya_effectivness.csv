"Im not sure with Gilenya as I have more symptoms and not sure if its MS or the drug! I have lower back pain and down the Left leg numbness chest area which I didnt have starting this drug.My numbness right side of my head has gone which is good. I have a MRI shortly on brain and spine to compare with last year and see Neuro which will be interesting.

"HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS: starting the first month: cough, brief headaches daily, loss of balance, muscle cramps in leg and arm that were already weakened by secondary progressive relapsing MS.  By fifth month: Worst 2 day pain ever in every muscle and joint of my body, falling every other day, seeing things moving that weren't moving, blurred vision, sore throat, hair loss, dry skin forgetting what I was saying mid-sentence, not to mention word recall.  All this and more. At first I thought it was my MS getting worse, Stopped Gilenya, side effects getting better, then SEVERE MUSCLE PAIN RETURNED in three weeks, along with swallowing difficulty.  Did these horrible side effects go away for anyone that experienced them even after stopping gilenya?",1
"Took Gilenya for 12 days and experienced several serious side effects and an onset of the disease it's meant to protect you from, MS. My symptoms included, dizziness, vertigo, balance issues, upset stomach,  weakness and tiredness, heart palpation s and chest tightness,diarrhea, light sensitivity and headaches. When I  stopped taking Gilenya these symptoms left after a couple of days but was left with really bad MS symptoms. I was healthy before I started this med and only took it because I'm always encouraged by health care workers to take meds to keep healthy. I'm back to a good diet, exercise and healthy supplements and NO MEDS! ",1
"I’m 26 years old and I was diagnosed with MS about a year and a half ago. I’m very asymptomatic, this means my symptoms may go unnoticed. Weakness in my legs and arms, and lack of sensitivity in my face are included on the symptoms I felt. 4 months ago I started the Gilenya treatment, the one and only drug I have ever taken for MS. At the same time, I started taking an orthomolecular treatment (big dose of vitamins and minerals) that my alternative Dr. – not neurologist – recommended. Also, moved on to a healthier lifestyle; I changed my ingesting habits (organic food and paleo diet), started making exercise a habit, and controlled my stress levels. A week ago, I received the results from my last MRI and not only NO new activity wasn’t found, but actually, 2 of the 3 existing lesions were GONE!! My neurologist, a typical poker-face Dr., was shocked with the results. His eyes were coming off his face due the shock. I don’t really know which one of the treatments helped, or if it was a combination of all of them (Gilenya, the alternative treatment and lifestyle), but I do know I’m feeling like I haven’t felt in a year.  I have never cried tears of happiness this hard in my entire life. I will keep fighting MS, with Gilenya, alternative treatment, and lifestyle until it’s completely gone. ",5
I have been taking Gilenya for a year now. I have a very stressful job and would have a relapse about every 3 months. I have not had a relapse with Gilenya. I feel like my old self. I definitely don't feel 100% if I forget to take the pill. I feel a bit off. So I make every effort to take it every day. ,5
"For me, Gilenya has been amazing!  I was diagnosed four years ago this month and initially put on Copaxone.  I hate needles and my condition was not improving on Copaxone; my MRIs were still showing active lesions and I was still having symptoms.  After eleven months on Copaxone my doctors decided to take me off it so I could try Gilenya.  After a few months and a round of SoluMedrol (my fifth in 16 months) my MRI showed no change, and it has been that way since October 2011.  I feel incredibly lucky to have found the right treatment for me.  I have no disability at all and a lot of the time I can forget that I have MS.  Gilenya has been a godsend!",5
I have been on Gilenya now for a month and I am very satisfied so far. The only symptoms I have encountered was vertigo for a few days and headaches here and there. Before I was on the pill my fatigue was out of control. Now I have my energy back! I am hopeful that this medicine will continue to help me continuing forward. ,4
"This drug has been terrific for me. I was on 2 injections, both stopped for side effects. Tried Tecfidera but side effects so bad ended up in ER. I've been taking Gilenya for about a month now, no side effects at all.",5
"On week 3 of taking the drug... I feel like my diarrhea will never stop! It comes and goes... Was on betaseron before, but hated the injections. This is much easier!! I'll live with the poops for a bit, but it is still better than the pain",4
,5
"i took Gilenya for around 12 months. During that time, my walking improved dramatically. I had been falling around once a month prior to Gilenya and did not fall at all when on it - in fact could run again. But vision in one eye became blurry and 3 ophthalmologists could not find the cause (was not macular edema and doesn't seem correctable with glasses) and i noticed in the package that a large number in the study reported blurry vision, so I changed to tecvidera.",5
"I have been taking the pill since nov. 2011 .. I'm walking much better (though I still can't wear heels) ,all MS symptoms  practically gone , I feel a lot better which also allows me to workout .. I feel like I did before 20 yrs before MS.. normal",5
"been taking this drug since 2009 and haven't had a replase since.
",5
I have been on Gilenya for 2 years and I felt it was working well until I ended up with cancer in my spine and lung. Not knowing if the cancer is Gilenya related my Neuro took me off the drug. After the cancer treatment is over I do plan on starting Gilenya again as my main M.S. treatment.,4
Super easy pill! However I developed shortness of breath when on drug. Started about one to two months afternoon drug. Dr did not relate shortness of breath to expiration/ asthma type problems until after a year of miscellaneous tests.  MRIs have been well and drug appears to work.  Package is difficult to open if you have hand difficulties. ,5
dizziness nausea hot flashes tiredness,3
"Gilenya has made a big positive difference in my life! Diagnosed with MS in 1999, I was on the injectible drug Avonex for 12 years before  Gilenya came out in 2011. Now I take my pill every night and have not had any side effects whatsoever. My energy level has gone up and I have never felt better. I feel like a normal person again, and I don't have to plan my day on injecting a needle into my  shoulder! Highly recommended.",5

"My husband took Gilenya from November 2011 until December 26, 2012. He began having severe depression, anger issues, comfusion, loss of memory. He also passed out in September 2012 while pumping gas. After the issues became so severe in December 2012, they were discussed with his neurologist. Upon the neurologist seaching his own patient files, several other Glenya patients of his were having the same problems. Husband has regained his sense of humor but memory and confusion still linger. I would be very wary of taking Gilenya. He has had MS since 1977 and has tried many other MS treatments for relapsing MS bu MS hasreally progressed in the last 5 years.",2
"I was on Avonex for 9 years, I begged my Dr. to take me off of the injections he refused. I switched to a new Dr. he told me that there were other options, I was excited about the pill. Has not effected my heart in any way, no side effects at all like I was expericing with Avonex. I would recommend the pill to anyone. The first dose, sitting in the Dr. office for 6 hours was nothing, I took my I Pad and the day passed by quickly.",5
"My neuro called and wanted me to come in to see him ASAP, he had my blood work back.  I've been on Gilenya since 8/11 and was very pleased with it.  I have been keeping a UTI infection and didn't know why.  last year in February, I had a grand maul seizure due to my temp going up to over 104 and was hospitalized with a very severe UTI. Now I know whey, I've been keeping an infection.  Just today, I saw my neuro and was told that my white blood cells count was 1,000, which is really low.  Should be between 4 to 5,000.  He has taken me off this drug and will be putting me on this new drug that's also a pill.  I don't know the name because for now I'm not taking anything.",5
"I have been on Gilenya since 6/2011. It had been working wonders for me until 1/13. This is when my immune system was completely broken down. What I mean by this is that my white blood cells droped so drastically low that I was getting thrush on my breast, constant yeast infections and colds that I could not fight. In February 2013 , my primary care doctor advised my that any common infection could literally kill me since my body was not producing enough white blood cells to fight. I went to my neurologist and he agreed that I must stop Gilenya immediately or I could die from any infection. He explained that the drug is not allowing my bone marrow to produce any white blood cells needed. The drug has worked wonders for my MS. I have no new lesions and I am stable however the medicine does not realize what are healthy cells with my body and what is bad. Instead of attacking T-cells it is attacking all cells. I am not saying this side effect happens to everyone what I am saying this is a side effect that people need to be aware of so they will know what is happening. When I started getting yeast infections that is commom for women it is not something that is usually discussed with your neuro doc. It was not until I went to my primary care doctor because I was running a fever of 102 and was extremely sick that blood work was done. It was on the low end from the start of taking this med. The new test showed 1.7 and all of my WBC catagories were well below normal. This is just for anyone taking this medication to be aware and to know what to look for as a side effect and question if this is not normal for your body.",5
"I have been on G for 11 months. I have been on Avonex, Rebif and Copaxone. I was dx MS 9.5 years ago... I am 36. Used to have a flare 1-3 times per year. Have not had one since I've been on G and MRI went from 9 active lesions to 1. I am back to running and working full time. The drug does make me dizzy and I have heart palpitations- hence the 4 stars rather than 5.",4
,3
"I have been taking Gilenya about 9 months now.  The first 6 months went ok, after blood tests for my liver the dr. took me off for 2 weeks and since I have started back, dizziness so bad if I am not holding on to something I feel like I would over.  My health insurance just notified me they will not continue to pay for Gilenya because of the cost.  ",2
"I am very happy to be free on needles. Gilenya has made treating my MS a lot easier. I set up to take my daily dose with my other pills every night at bedtime, making it more convient to stay with my therapy.",5
So far the only side effect I have had (besides the expected drop in lymphosites...if that's the right word) is that I have a mild cough.  I just have a little patch in my throat and occasionally it makes me cough.,4
"Really bad side effects.  Confusion, perceived heart attack, depression, everything that could have happened, happened.  Finally taken off if it and now suffering from joint pain, neck and back pain that I did not hae before I started this med.  I am not a doc but believe it is a permanent side effect of this drug.  I suffered SEVERE back pain during the use and its not as bad since I stopped.  I could not even get up in the morning I felt so bad.  My behavior was erratic and confusing to others and I really thought I ahd lost my mind.  Right now I have stopped MS treatment because I am terrified of side effects.  I was taking copaxone before with no side effects but the shot caused me so much aniexty that I would stay up at night just not to give it to myself.  Then Is started skipping the shots so we opted to try this drug.  My side effects were so bad that I actually was scared to sleep because I was scared I would not wake up. ",1
"My daughter has MS, was diagnosed 4 years ago.  She stopped all injectable medications due to side effects.  With this oral medication, she takes it on time and does not miss a dose.  Side effects have been acceptable.",4
i have been on gilenya for 1 1/2 years and my overall function has significantly improved since taking this drug - and without side effects,5
"I have not started this medication yet.I received it on Fri.I wanted to do a little more research on it before I started it,I have heard it can cause heart blockage,liver problems which I already have.I called my Drs.office on Fri.to let them know I had gotten the meds and told her I needed a little more time and she told me he wanted to do it on Wed.since he had rounds that day and I would be in the hospital for 24hrs.So yesterday he called me and said whats the plan and I told him I wanted to wait a little longer and he told me he couldn't treat me anymore and I was fired.He also called the Gilenya people and tod them not to send me anymore pills,and the gilenya people called and informed me that they had differant meds which I didn't know about and maybe they didn't have as many side effects.I had previosy been on Avonex and was sick for 13 weeks and it affected my liver realy bad so I quit taking it and a few days later I was back to normal so maybe I'm a little sciddesh about the meds but I don't think I deserved to be fired.",1
"I started Gilenya in January. It took a long time to figure out what to go on since I was on Tysabri..taking it every two months and it worked great. I talked to 2 of the best neurologists in my state and boh agreed for me it would work. I have been on it since and have had no relapse like my doctor said I might from switching drugs. I am very happy with the results, and the side effects are minimal. Many are concerned about the first dosage, but when I went I brought someone who would keep my mind off of it and they said my heart rate was one of the best they've seen. In my opinion it is a stressful time, but in my opinion do what you can to take you rmind off of it and it will probably go better than you think. But overall I am very happy with the drug, and the fact that it is a pill makes me remember to take my vitamins as well:-)",5
"I just turned 50, and after discovering my MS over 15 years ago, am doing better than ever.  All I wanted after my diagnosis (aside from them being wrong about it), was a pill form of treatment rather than the injections.  Don't know if any of these medications are actually doing anything, of if it's coincidence, but my last MRI showed NO NEW LEISIONS and some may have been smaller.  I'm all for it.  NO side affects at all.  Thanks Dr. B, for allowing me the chance to try it.
",5

"After 12 years of injection site lumps and pain, this is pure heaven. I actually cried when my dr told me that a pill form was available. And then to have no side effects was a dream come true. I am healthier than i was 13 years ago. No relapses. I still can't believe it. And my first MRI after a year showed no new activity and one lesion actually disappeared.",5
"Seems to be working, can't beat a once a day pill.",5

"Started taking thedrug in October of last year (2011) no side effects.  Walking is much better, very noticable by others.  Hand writing with right hand is also much improved.  So much better than any other treatment that I've used
",4
"I been on it for over a year and have had no side effects! I also had an increased libido, great side effect. I am feeling stronger, faster, and much more energy. Great drug.",5
Have been on medication for a couple weeks.  No major side effects and I am glad to say that I think I have some improvement.  The swellig feeling that I have on the botton of my feet feels alot better. Am able to bend my toes without feeling that they are going to break...I am excited hope it gets better,4
"I took my 1st dose on Nov 30th, 2011. For the month of December I experienced some lower back pain, extreme fatigue and headaches.  Since then things have improved significantly.  I am no longer having ANY side effects. I am seeing my neurologist at the end of January to find out my blood test results...fingers crossed.",4
"After some initial nausea and related G/I stuff, I am thrilled to report that my walking  has improved significantly.  Faster, stronger, less limping, greater endurance.  And here's a sweet little bonus: Amped up sex drive.  Seriously, my libido and sensations have come back with a vengeance!  Best drug ever!!",4
"I have  been taking it for 3 weeks so far so it's hard to put a effectiveness rating but at least I haven't had any new or worsening symptoms. In fact my spasticity may be a little better. I have noticed weight gain (5 lbs in the first week which was alarming, but then it stabilized), yeast infection and canker sores also within a week of starting it, heart rate up and down, occasional dizziness and some fatigue (but not as bad as a bout of MS related fatigue). I was on Tysabri before this and did have the same problem with yeast infections recurring during the first 6 months of treatment, and am hopeful that it won't be as bad with Gilenya but am trying over the counter yeast infection prevention as well as avoiding yeast/sugary foods. Anyway, a pill is more convenient, plus less serious side effect profile than Tysabri, so I'm going with it for now. Gilenya has an assistance program that you don't need to be financially strapped to take advantage of - just don't let the Gilenya Go Program representative forget to make it work for you (pays your co-pay if you have insurance for the first year, plus the copays for the pre-treatment labs/exams).",4
"So far, so good.  I'm not experiencing any side effects, no exacerbations. :) An answer to my prayers...",5
I've been on Gilenya for 1 year this week and have had no new symptoms or side effects AT ALL. I've been extremely pleased. I was diagnosed 5 years ago and have done Beta Serone and Copaxone both with a lot of side effects. No more shots! I will continue on as long as there's no future complications with the med.,5
"They really downplay possible serious side effects.  I have almost gone blind taking this. I developed Macular Edema and am now going broke going to 2 eye specialists. 1st case they have seen. Trying to have a rep call me back from the co. to tell me what long term side effects I will have was a joke I was told no one can help me.  As a nurse I am so disappointed.  I really thought that this drug would help my M.S. but it has just cost me a ton of $ and now they won't even let me take my Avonex because no one knows if this will make me worse.  Now my M.S. is getting worse. I warn everyone I read the small print, was cleared to go on this med.  Macular Edema is a serious and potentially devastating disease.   Think twice about taking it.  When your vision starts to blur don't think it is the M.S. I lost all vision in my right eye within 20 days of taking this med.  Not worth it.",1
"I was a bit hesitant of taking Gilenya, as I already have bad eye issues and asthma. I’ve been on it for 6 months now and I can honestly say it’s the best I’ve felt since 2004 (when I was diagnosed). I’ve taken: Beta Seron, Copaxone, and Tysabri (Copaxone being my least favorite).  I loved Tysabri, but it wasn’t doing the job, so they put me on Gilenya. I noticed that I was a little out of breath doing normal activities the first few weeks after starting it, but it was only for the first few weeks.  I am usually a troll in the sun anyways, and I feared my eyes were not going to be able to handle it…but I’ve had no problems!! It’s easier and less painful than taking a shot. I have gained a little bit of weight, but I could chalk that up to the new birth control pills I started around the same time (a little meaning 5 pounds). I just hope it continues to work as well as it is… I go to my neurologist in December and I’m sure they will give me an MRI…I’ll let you know how things are going!",4
"I started Gilenya in Feb, 2011 after failing all the injectable MS meds.  I was diagnosed in 2007, and initially, I felt the best I had felt in 4 years!  In May, I hiked over 2 miles up a steep mountain, and felt like my life was finally going to be back to normal.  Then, in July, I started the worst relapse ever.  I am still not back to my baseline and I fear the Gilenya may not be working.  My eyes are definitely more light sensitive and actually hurt sometimes.  I have gained almost a pound a month, despite a very disciplined diet.  I am likely going to stop this med if I don't start feeling better soon and stop gaining weight!!",2
,5
"After treating MS with injection and having terrile side effects I refused to take them and then finally talked my Dr. into allowing me to try this I am very pleased.  NO SIDE effects.  Much easier than shots every other day and much less sickness/fatigue.  I just started this so I can't judge effectiveness just yet, but overall WAY BETTER than injections..",3
"When I first tried the drug, both blood pressure (BP) and heart rate low, esp. BP extremely low 67/40.  Waited 2 weeks, tried again at different sight, BP lowered only to 90/60) (tendency to have low BP 100/60, so no risk of increased high blood pressure.  After start taking drug, didn't feel well. WBC (white blood count, very tired, fatigued, felt like flu-like symptoms, had a cough (for a week). These subsided except WBC kept lowering,and then had low back pain, spasms worsen (definitely felt like have exacberation. My legs, feet, toes, ankles have worsen or spasms for the first time. Walking isn't good. My body feels worse than I started.  I hope the spasticity gets better and low back pain goes away.  Will return back to copaxone.",1
"I was diag over  uyrs ago with MS with no treatment until n ow. The Gilenya sounded really great so I decided to gived it a try.  Th week I had my first dose with no problems until I got home.  I feel like a complete relapse has taken over my body.  Thin gs where moving, I called my Gilenta support andc the informed me to contact my dr which I did and she informed me to stop taking it and get to my eye dr ASAP to get che checked.  The vision side effect of Macular edema is not suppose to show up for 3 mths or longer.  My eye dfr c ould not believe what he was seeing.  My eyes where moving up and down so much he could n ot even do a good exam, said I was having rapid vertical mystagmus going on in b oth eyes.  To sum it up I can not see very muc h at all along with tightness in my throat, heaveyness in my chest, baCK & feet. My walking is like I have a overhang , ear lobes feel like there is novacaine in them along with tingeling in my hands.  I am a mess right now and dcont think I will go bavk o n this.  Good luck to all that are trying it I guess my nervous system does not like it.  I just want to be able to see, walk and feel things again.",1
"Have done all ms rxs with none helping enough to justify bad side effects. Was in trial and did great, until ast/alt levels 5x. Neuro okd trying again when approved. Love it still, but liver acting up again. Now taking every other day crossing my fingers ",5
"I am now into my 6th week on Gilenya. I initially had throat issues,but that has gone away. Also, I experienced some hip pain which has subsided as well. I feel very fortunate to have no ongoing side effects. Some difficulty with falling asleep, creating tough bouts with fatigue, but I feel that is not related to Gilenya. A couple Sominex has helped the problem greatly. I'm not unrealistic about improvement, I only hope for slower progression. So far, so good. Positive attitude goes a long way. Don't concentrate on what you can't do anymore, but what you CAN do. Good luck to all.         Len Cara on Facebook  ",3
"I am almost to my third month on this medication.  Within the first week of being on it I started having a serious exasterbation of symptoms.  I have tremors that run all the way to my neck, my legs have just recently started showing signs of tremors as well.  I am tired constantly. My head aches almost all day every day.  I started with numbness and tingling in my toes it now goes to my knees and my hands are now starting to act up too.  My muscles feel like they are trying to pull themselves from the bone. And my back spasms regularly...more noticably at night I think because I am trying to relax to fall asleep and my body is refusing to do so.  My doctor put me on steriods to try and control the exasterbation and instead we found out that i am allergic to Solumedrol...so now to add to all the symptoms I'm having I have a terrible rash all over my back and face and pretty intense swelling.  I want so badly to feel somewhat normal and this has actually made me worse...so it looks like shots are in order for me and I'm even more scared of those. ",2
"I was on the study of this drug for 2 yrs, now on actual drug since March 2011. Don't know if it is helping, I'm hoping. I'm in a huge relapse since Feb '10. So I'm hoping that it can keep me from progressing. I need to heal because this is the worst since I was diagnosed in 1991. Was good for most of my adult life till past 4 yrs gone to pot..lol. O'well hoping for symptoms to back off for a bit.",3
"I was diagnosed in March of 2009. I have moderate to severe problems with mobility. I use a cane or crutch to assist with balance and weakness. There are also mild issues with eyesight and muscle weakness. I used Copaxone for 15 months with no changes to my symptoms positively or negatively(no progression!) I have been taking Gilenya for three weeks with no side effects. If all this drug does for me is delay progression, therby maintaining my current quality of life, I will consider it successful. I have MS, it doesn't have me. Good luck to all of you.",4
"I have been very pleased with Gilenya and its ease of use however, about 4 to 6 weeks after beginning it, I developed mild but annoying achy hip joints.  ",4
"It might be too soon to tell as I have only been on this med for 3 weeks, but over all it seems to be effective and no more shots!!!  My scar tissue had really piled up and this is so much better.  A few minor sinus/throat irritations but so-far so-good!
Thanks to whomever founded this new med!",4
"I had posted my symptoms on 3/16 and see someone else posted the same side effects! It was horrible! The minute I told my doctor what was going on he took me right off the Gilenya.  I felt better within a couple of days.  I am still taking a break from the meds and am now feeling symptoms of my ms.  I will be going back on the AVONEX in a couple of weeks.  The tremors, heart pounding out of my chest, dizziness and lump in my throat were the worst side effects from any drug I have ever taken. It's hard enough dealing with the ms. If the side effects out weigh the benefits then it's not a good choice.   ",1
"After using Avonex for 10 years, I am now experiencing the side effects, flu-like symptoms, stronger and longer lasting.",3
Appreciate the ease after years of unpleasant injection site reactions.  *However* the constant bronchitis and minor infections are making me start to consider returning to Betaseron.  I hated the shots but hate being constantly sick more.,4
I have been on the drug for over 90 days.  Less brain fog however two significant relapses.,3
This medication is helping my vision.  Prior of taking Gilenya my vision was very blury and know I do not have to wear my glass.  ,4
"First , I gave 1 star for effectiveness because it's too soon to tell if it's working. It's been over 2 weeks & already my hair is falling out , I've put on weight , noticed my walking is not as brisk and overall feel very fatigued. I'm going to stick with it for a month because I'm hoping these side effects will pass. As long as I feel pretty good otherwise , we'll see hot it goes.",1
" 
I have been on Gilenya for 2 weeks and I started having side effects: tremors, light headed/dizzy, swelling in my throat, jaw tightness, nauseous, heavy chested and my heart is racing. I called my Gilenya support nurse and she recommended calling my doctor right away. My doctor directed me to stop taking Gilenya. **If the female that posted on 3/16 reads this, who had the similiar side effects, would you please post again to let us know what happened.  ",1
"I started taking these meds about 2 months ago...at first i had mild diarrhea for 2 weeks on and off...then about 1-2 migrains a week for about 3 weeks (imitrex knocked them out tho), now I'm experiencing muscle tightness when i wake up in the morning...not sure if thats a side effect or my regular MS...i was diagnosed in 2006 and used copaxone for 4 -5 years, got tired of the bruises and painful injections...didnt take anything else until they made this pill...all in all...super satisfied :-) any direct questions feel free to contact my twitter",5
"I was extremely sensitive to the side effects of the other MS medications. Gilenya is by far the best! I only get slight headaches and slight muscle tension but nothing like I had with Beta-Seron, Rebif, or Copaxone. I feel 100% better on this drug compared to the 3 previously mentioned. My eyes are slightly more sensitive to light but I have not experienced any other symptoms.",4
"I have been on Gilenya for a month now and two weeks ago I started noticing side effects: tremors, light headed, swelling in my throat, nauseous and my heart is pounding heavy.  I have called my Gilenya support nurse and she recommended calling my doctor right away.  I hope everything will be ok because I don’t want to have to go back on Avonex and weekly shots.",3
This medication was the last medication left to try for me. I've been on all of the other therapy medication's. By far Gilenya has made a difference. I no longer have to give myself shots. That means no more bruies!!!! I am very satisfied with the outcome of this medication. ,4
"This is so much better than injections!  I have been waiting 11 years for this, but if my insurance doesn't cover the costs, then it'll be back to the shot for me.  I couldn't believe the cost per month when I saw it!",5
"Waited 11 years for last Wednesday, the day I started taking Gilenya. Only issue so far is mini headaches that stay for a few minutes and go away.....NO MORE NEEDLES!!!!",5
"Been in the clinical trial for 3.5 years and know I've been on drug for at least the last 1.5...No exacerbations and I feel better than I've felt in years!  Only a little sensitivity to light in my eyes.  Otherwise it's been great!  Cost is the only drawback, but for now Novartis is picking up my copay.  When that ends...I stop taking the drug.",5
no side effects for me,5
"I have relapsing/remitting MS and I have been on Gilenya for almost a month now.  The required 6 hour doctor visit for your first dose was actually not that bad.  There were a few of us and Novartis provided breakfast and lunch.  I had no side affects during that time, however, on the drive home I started getting tunnel vision and feeling faint. I had to pull over a couple of times.  So from that experience if you can get someone to drive you home DO IT!  
Before starting the drug I had numbness on the side of my stomach, now it is gone.  Could just be a coincidence as my symptoms come and go with my stress level.",4
